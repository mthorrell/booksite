It is the only form of adventure in\\nwhich you put on your clothes at Michaelmas and keep them on until\\nChristmas, and, save for a layer of the natural grease of the body, find\\nthem as clean as though they were new. It is more lonely than London,\\nmore secluded than any monastery, and the post comes but once a year. As\\nmen will compare the hardships of France, Palestine, or Mesopotamia, so\\nit would be interesting to contrast the rival claims of the Antarctic as\\na medium of discomfort. A member of Campbell\'s party tells me that the\\ntrenches at Ypres were a comparative picnic. But until somebody can\\nevolve a standard of endurance I am unable to see how it can be done.\\nTake it all in all, I do not believe anybody on earth has a worse time\\nthan an Emperor penguin.\\nEven now the Antarctic is to the rest of the earth as the Abode of the\\nGods was to the ancient Chaldees, a precipitous and mammoth land lying\\nfar beyond the seas which encircled man\'s habitation, and nothing is more\\nstriking about the exploration of the Southern Polar regions than its\\nabsence, for when King Alfred reigned in England the Vikings were\\nnavigating the ice-fields of the North; yet when Wellington fought the\\nbattle of Waterloo there was still an undiscovered continent in the\\nSouth.\\nFor those who wish to read an account of the history of Antarctic\\nexploration there is an excellent chapter in Scott\'s Voyage of the\\nDiscovery and elsewhere. I do not propose to give any general survey of\\nthis kind here, but complaints have been made to me that Scott\'s Last\\nExpedition plunges the general reader into a neighbourhood which he is\\nsupposed to know all about, while actually he is lost, having no idea\\nwhat the Discovery was, or where Castle Rock or Hut Point stand. For the\\nbetter understanding of the references to particular expeditions, to the\\nlands discovered by them and the traces left by them, which must occur in\\nthis book I give the following brief introduction.\\nFrom the earliest days of the making of maps of the Southern Hemisphere\\nit was supposed that there was a great continent called Terra Australis.\\nAs explorers penetrated round the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, and\\nfound nothing but stormy oceans beyond, and as, later, they discovered\\nAustralia and New Zealand, the belief in this continent weakened, but was\\nnot abandoned. During the latter half of the eighteenth century eagerness\\nfor scientific knowledge was added to the former striving after\\nindividual or State aggrandizement.\\nCook, Ross and Scott: these are the aristocrats of the South.\\nIt was the great English navigator James Cook who laid the foundations of\\nour knowledge. In 1772 he sailed from Deptford in the Resolution, 462\\ntons, and the Adventure, 336 tons, ships which had been built at Whitby\\nfor the coal trade. He was, like Nansen, a believer in a varied diet as\\none of the preventives of scurvy, and mentions that he had among his\\nprovisions \\"besides Saur Krout, Portable Broth, Marmalade of Carrots and\\nSuspissated juice of Wort and Beer.\\" Medals were struck \\"to be given to\\nthe natives of new discovered countries, and left there as testimonies of\\nour being the first discoverers.\\"[1] It would be interesting to know\\nwhether any exist now.\\nAfter calling at the Cape of Good Hope Cook started to make his Easting\\ndown to New Zealand, purposing to sail as far south as possible in search\\nof a southern continent. He sighted his first \'ice island\' or iceberg in\\nlat. 50\xb0 40\xb4 S., long. 2\xb0 0\xb4 E., on December 10, 1772. The next day he\\n\\"saw some white birds about the size of pigeons, with blackish bills and\\nfeet. I never saw any such before.\\"[2] These must have been Snowy Petrel.\\nPassing through many bergs, where he notices how the albatross left them\\nand penguins appeared, he was brought up by thick pack ice along which he\\ncoasted. Under the supposition that this ice was formed in bays and\\nrivers Cook was led to believe that land was not far distant.\\nIncidentally he remarks that in order to enable his men to support the\\ncolder weather he \\"caused the sleeves of their jackets (which were so\\nshort as to expose their arms) to be lengthened with baize; and had a cap\\nmade for each man of the same stuff, together with canvas; which proved\\nof great service to them.\\"[3]\\nFor more than a month Cook sailed the Southern Ocean, always among bergs\\nand often among pack. The weather was consistently bad and generally\\nthick; he mentions that he had only seen the moon once since leaving the\\nCape.\\nIt was on Sunday, January 17, 1773, that the Antarctic Circle was crossed\\nfor the first time, in longitude 39\xb0 35\xb4 E. After proceeding to latitude\\n67\xb0 15\xb4 S. he was stopped by an immense field of pack. From this point he\\nturned back and made his way to New Zealand.\\nLeaving New Zealand at the end of 1773 without his second ship, the\\nAdventure, from which he had been parted, he judged from the great swell\\nthat \\"there can be no land to the southward, under the meridian of New\\nZealand, but what must lie very far to the south.\\" In latitude 62\xb0 10\xb4 S.\\nhe sighted the first ice island on December 12, and was stopped by thick\\npack ice three days later. On the 20th he again crossed the Antarctic\\nCircle in longitude 147\xb0 46\xb4 W. and penetrated in this neighbourhood to a\\nlatitude of 67\xb0 31\xb4 S. Here he found a drift towards the north-east.\\nOn January 26, 1774, in longitude 109\xb0 31\xb4 W., he crossed the Antarctic\\nCircle for the third time, after meeting no pack and only a few icebergs.\\nIn latitude 71\xb0 10\xb4 S. he was finally turned back by an immense field of\\npack, and wrote:\\n\\"I will not say it was impossible anywhere to get farther to the south;\\nbut the attempting it would have been a dangerous and rash enterprise,\\nand what, I believe, no man in my situation would have thought of. It\\nwas, indeed, my opinion, as well as the opinion of most on board, that\\nthis ice extended quite to the Pole, or perhaps joined to some land, to\\nwhich it had been fixed from the earliest time; and that it is here, that\\nis to the south of this parallel, where all the ice we find scattered up\\nand down to the north is first formed, and afterwards broken off by gales\\nof wind, or other causes, and brought to the north by the currents, which\\nare always found to set in that direction in the high latitudes. As we\\ndrew near this ice some penguins were heard, but none seen; and but few\\nother birds, or any other thing that could induce us to think any land\\nwas near. And yet I think there must be some to the south beyond this\\nice; but if there is it can afford no better retreat for birds, or any\\nother animals, than the ice itself, with which it must be wholly covered.\\nI, who had ambition not only to go farther than any one had been before,\\nbut as far as it was possible for man to go, was not sorry at meeting\\nwith this interruption; as it, in some measure, relieved us; at least,\\nshortened the dangers and hardships inseparable from the navigation of\\nthe Southern Polar regions.\\"[4]\\nAnd so he turned northwards, when, being \\"taken ill of the bilious\\ncolic,\\" a favourite dog belonging to one of the officers (Mr. Forster,\\nafter whom Aptenodytes forsteri, the Emperor penguin, is named) \\"fell a\\nsacrifice to my tender stomach.... Thus I received nourishment and\\nstrength, from food which would have made most people in Europe sick: so\\ntrue it is that necessity is governed by no law.\\"[5]\\n\\"Once and for all the idea of a populous fertile southern continent was\\nproved to be a myth, and it was clearly shown that whatever land might\\nexist to the South must be a region of desolation hidden beneath a mantle\\nof ice and snow. The vast extent of the tempestuous southern seas was\\nrevealed, and the limits of the habitable globe were made known.\\nIncidentally it may be remarked that Cook was the first to describe the\\npeculiarities of the Antarctic icebergs and floe-ice.\\"[6]\\nA Russian expedition under Bellingshausen discovered the first certain\\nland in the Antarctic in 1819, and called it Alexander Land, which lies\\nnearly due south of Cape Horn.","image":"C00.01.png"},{"merge":"C00.02","output":"The passage describes the early discoveries of the Antarctic continent by ships arriving mainly to hunt whales and seals, and James Clark Ross\'s expedition in 1840-1843, which discovered and named many Antarctic geographic features, including the Ross Ice Shelf.

One cannot read the simple, unaffected narratives of\\nthese voyages without being assured of their veracity, and without being\\nstruck by the wonderful pertinacity and courage which they display.\\"[7]\\nThe position in 1840 was that the Antarctic land had been sighted at a\\nfew points all round its coasts. On the whole the boundaries which had\\nbeen seen lay on or close to the Antarctic Circle, and it appeared\\nprobable that the continent, if continent it was, consisted of a great\\ncircular mass of land with the South Pole at its centre, and its coasts\\nmore or less equidistant from this point.\\nTwo exceptions only to this had been found. Cook and Bellingshausen had\\nindicated a dip towards the Pole south of the Pacific; Weddell a still\\nmore pronounced dip to the south of the Atlantic, having sailed to a\\nlatitude of 74\xb0 15\xb4 S. in longitude 34\xb0 16\xb4 W.\\nHad there been a Tetrahedronal Theory in those days, some one might have\\nsuggested the probability of a third indentation beneath the Indian\\nOcean, probably to be laughed at for his pains. When James Clark Ross\\nstarted from England in 1839 there was no particular reason for him to\\nsuppose that the Antarctic coast-line in the region of the magnetic Pole,\\nwhich he was to try to reach, did not continue to follow the Antarctic\\nCircle.\\nRoss left England in September 1839 under instructions from the\\nAdmiralty. He had under his command two of Her Majesty\'s sailing ships,\\nthe Erebus, 370 tons, and the Terror, 340 tons. Arriving in Hobart,\\nTasmania, in August 1840, he was met by news of discoveries made during\\nthe previous summer by the French Expedition under Dumont D\'Urville and\\nthe United States Expedition under Charles Wilkes. The former had coasted\\nalong Ad\xe9lie Land, and for sixty miles of ice cliff to the west of it. He\\nbrought back an egg now at Drayton which Scott\'s Discovery Expedition\\ndefinitely proved to be that of an Emperor penguin.\\nAll these discoveries were somewhere about the latitude of the Antarctic\\nCircle (66\xb0 32\xb4 S.) and roughly in that part of the world which lies to\\nthe south of Australia. Ross, \\"impressed with the feeling that England\\nhad ever _led_ the way of discovery in the southern as well as in the\\nnorthern region, ... resolved at once to avoid all interference with\\ntheir discoveries, and selected a much more easterly meridian (170\xb0 E.),\\non which to penetrate to the southward, and if possible reach the\\nmagnetic Pole.\\"[8]\\nThe outlines of the expedition in which an unknown and unexpected sea was\\nfound, stretching 500 miles southwards towards the Pole, are well known\\nto students of Antarctic history. After passing through the pack he stood\\ntowards the supposed position of the magnetic Pole, \\"steering as nearly\\nsouth by the compass as the wind admitted,\\" and on January 11, 1841, in\\nlatitude 71\xb0 15\xb4 S., he sighted, the white peaks of Mount Sabine and\\nshortly afterwards Cape Adare. Foiled by the presence of land from\\ngaining the magnetic Pole, he turned southwards (true) into what is now\\ncalled the Ross Sea, and, after spending many days in travelling down\\nthis coast-line with the mountains on his right hand, the Ross Sea on his\\nleft, he discovered and named the great line of mountains which here for\\nsome five hundred miles divides the sea from the Antarctic plateau. On\\nJanuary 27, \\"with a favourable breeze and very clear weather, we stood to\\nthe southward, close to some land which had been in sight since the\\npreceding noon, and which we then called the High Island; it proved to be\\na mountain twelve thousand four hundred feet of elevation above the level\\nof the sea, emitting flame and smoke in great profusion; at first the\\nsmoke appeared like snowdrift, but as we drew nearer its true character\\nbecame manifest.... I named it Mount Erebus, and an extinct volcano to\\nthe eastward, little inferior in height, being by measurement ten\\nthousand nine hundred feet high, was called Mount Terror.\\" That is the\\nfirst we hear of our two old friends, and Ross Island is the land upon\\nwhich they stand.\\n\\"As we approached the land under all studding-sails we perceived a low\\nwhite line extending from its eastern extreme point as far as the eye\\ncould discern to the eastward. It presented an extraordinary appearance,\\ngradually increasing in height as we got nearer to it, and proving at\\nlength to be a perpendicular cliff of ice, between one hundred and fifty\\nand two hundred feet above the level of the sea, perfectly flat and level\\nat the top, and without any fissures or promontories on its even seaward\\nface.\\"[9]\\nRoss coasted along the Barrier for some 250 miles from Cape Crozier, as\\nhe called the eastern extremity of Ross Island, after the commander of\\nthe Terror. This point where land, sea and moving Barrier meet will be\\nconstantly mentioned in this narrative. Returning, he looked into the\\nSound which divides Ross Island from the western mountains. On February\\n16 \\"Mount Erebus was seen at 2.30 A.M., and, the weather becoming very\\nclear, we had a splendid view of the whole line of coast, to all\\nappearance connecting it with the main land, which we had not before\\nsuspected to be the case.\\" The reader will understand that Ross makes a\\nmistake here, since Mounts Erebus and Terror are upon an island connected\\nto the mainland only by a sheet of ice. He continues: \\"A very deep bight\\nwas observed to extend far to the south-west from Cape Bird [Bird was the\\nsenior lieutenant of the Erebus], in which a line of low land might be\\nseen; but its determination was too uncertain to be left unexplored; and\\nas the wind blowing feebly from the west prevented our making any way in\\nthat direction through the young ice that now covered the surface of the\\nocean in every part, as far as we could see from the mast-head, I\\ndetermined to steer towards the bight to give it a closer examination,\\nand to learn with more certainty its continuity or otherwise. At noon we\\nwere in latitude 76\xb0 32\xb4 S., longitude 166\xb0 12\xb4 E., dip 88\xb0 24\xb4 and\\nvariation 107\xb0 18\xb4 E.\\n\\"During the afternoon we were nearly becalmed, and witnessed some\\nmagnificent eruptions of Mount Erebus, the flame and smoke being\\nprojected to a great height; but we could not, as on a former occasion,\\ndiscover any lava issuing from the crater; although the exhibitions of\\nto-day were upon a much grander scale....\\n\\"Soon after midnight (February 16-17) a breeze sprang up from the\\neastward and we made all sail to the southward until 4 A.M., although we\\nhad an hour before distinctly traced the land entirely round the bay\\nconnecting Mount Erebus with the mainland. I named it McMurdo Bay, after\\nthe senior lieutenant of the Terror, a compliment that his zeal and skill\\nwell merited.\\"[10] It is now called McMurdo Sound.\\nIn making the mistake of connecting Erebus with the mainland Ross was\\nlooking at a distance upon the Hut Point Peninsula running out from the\\nS.W. corner of Erebus towards the west. He probably saw Minna Bluff,\\nwhich juts out from the mainland towards the east. Between them, and in\\nfront of the Bluff, lie White Island, Black Island and Brown Island. To\\nsuppose them to be part of a line of continuous land was a very natural\\nmistake.\\nRoss broke through the pack ice into an unknown sea: he laid down many\\nhundreds of miles of mountainous coast-line, and (with further work\\ncompleted in 1842) some 400 miles of the Great Ice Barrier: he penetrated\\nin his ships to the extraordinarily high latitude of 78\xb0 11\xb4 S., four\\ndegrees farther than Weddell. The scientific work of his expedition was\\nno less worthy of praise. The South Magnetic Pole was fixed with\\ncomparative accuracy, though Ross was disappointed in his natural but\\n\\"perhaps too ambitious hope I had so long cherished of being permitted to\\nplant the flag of my country on both the magnetic Poles of our globe.\\"\\nBefore all things he was at great pains to be accurate, both in his\\ngeographical and scientific observations, and his records of meteorology,\\nwater temperatures, soundings, as also those concerning the life in the\\noceans through which he passed, were not only frequent but trustworthy.","image":"C00.02.png"},{"merge":"C00.03","output":"The passage is about the significance of the Ross expedition to the Antarctic in the mid-19th century, which made important discoveries about the geography, oceanography, and natural history of the region.

At the same time there was no\\nproof that the various blocks of land which had been discovered were\\nconnected with one another. Even now in 1921, after twenty years of\\ndetermined exploration aided by the most modern appliances, the interior\\nof this supposed continent is entirely unknown and uncharted except in\\nthe Ross Sea area, while the fringes of the land are only discovered in\\nperhaps a dozen places on a circumference of about eleven thousand miles.\\nIn his Life of Sir Joseph Hooker, Dr. Leonard Huxley has given us some\\ninteresting sidelights on this expedition under Ross. Hooker was the\\nbotanist of the expedition and assistant surgeon to the Erebus, being 22\\nyears old when he left England in 1839. Natural history came off very\\nbadly in the matter of equipment from the Government, who provided\\ntwenty-five reams of paper, two botanizing vascula and two cases for\\nbringing home live plants: that was all, not an instrument, nor a book,\\nnor a bottle, and rum from the ship\'s stores was the only preservative.\\nAnd when they returned, the rich collections which they brought back were\\nnever fully worked out. Ross\'s special branch of science was terrestrial\\nmagnetism, but he was greatly interested in Natural History, and gave up\\npart of his cabin for Hooker to work in. \\"Almost every day I draw,\\nsometimes all day long and till two and three in the morning, the Captain\\ndirecting me; he sits on one side of the table, writing and figuring at\\nnight, and I on the other, drawing. Every now and then he breaks off and\\ncomes to my side, to see what I am after ...\\" and, \\"as you may suppose,\\nwe have had one or two little tiffs, neither of us perhaps being helped\\nby the best of tempers; but nothing can exceed the liberality with which\\nhe has thrown open his cabin to me and made it my workroom at no little\\ninconvenience to himself.\\"\\nAnother extract from Hooker\'s letters after the first voyage runs as\\nfollows:\\n\\"The success of the Expedition in Geographical discovery is really\\nwonderful, and only shows what a little perseverance will do, for we have\\nbeen in no dangerous predicaments, and have suffered no hardships\\nwhatever: there has been a sort of freemasonry among Polar voyagers to\\nkeep up the credit they have acquired as having done wonders, and\\naccordingly, such of us as were new to the ice made up our minds for\\nfrost-bites, and attached a most undue importance to the simple operation\\nof boring packs, etc., which have now vanished, though I am not going to\\ntell everybody so; I do not here refer to travellers, who do indeed\\nundergo unheard-of hardships, but to voyagers who have a snug ship, a\\nlittle knowledge of the Ice, and due caution is all that is required.\\"\\nIn the light of Scott\'s leading of the expedition of which I am about to\\ntell, and the extraordinary scientific activity of Pennell in command of\\nthe Terra Nova after Scott was landed, Hooker would have to qualify a\\nlater extract, \\"nor is it probable that any future collector will have a\\nCaptain so devoted to the cause of Marine Zoology, and so constantly on\\nthe alert to snatch the most trifling opportunities of adding to the\\ncollection....\\"\\nFinally, we have a picture of the secrecy which was imposed upon all with\\nregard to the news they should write home and the precautions against any\\nleakage of scientific results. And we see Hooker jumping down the main\\nhatch with a penguin skin in his hand which he was preparing for himself,\\nwhen Ross came up the after hatch unexpectedly. That _has_ happened on\\nthe Terra Nova!\\nRoss had a cold reception on his return, and Scott wrote to Hooker in\\n1905:\\n\\"At first it seems inexplicable when one considers how highly his work is\\nnow appreciated. From the point of view of the general public, however, I\\nhave always thought that Ross was neglected, and as you once said he is\\nvery far from doing himself justice in his book. I did not know that\\nBarrow was the b\xeate noire who did so much to discount Ross\'s results. It\\nis an interesting sidelight on such a venture.\\"[11]\\nIn discussing and urging the importance of the Antarctic Expedition which\\nwas finally sent under Scott in the Discovery, Hooker urged the\\nimportance of work in the South Polar Ocean, which swarms with animal and\\nvegetable life. Commenting upon the fact that the large collections made\\nchiefly by himself had never been worked out, except the diatoms, he\\nwrites:\\n\\"A better fate, I trust, awaits the treasures that the hoped-for\\nExpedition will bring back, for so prolific is the ocean that the\\nnaturalist need never be idle, no, not even for one of the twenty-four\\nhours of daylight during a whole Antarctic summer, and I look to the\\nresults of a comparison of the oceanic life of the Arctic and Antarctic\\nregions as the heralding of an epoch in the history of biology.\\"[12]\\nWhen Ross went to the Antarctic it was generally thought that there was\\nneither food nor oxygen nor light in the depths of the ocean, and that\\ntherefore there was no life. Among other things the investigations of\\nRoss gave ground for thinking this was not the case. Later still, in\\n1873, the possibility of laying submarine cables made it necessary to\\ninvestigate the nature of the abyssal depths, and the Challenger proved\\nthat not only does life, and in quite high forms, exist there, but that\\nthere are fish which can see. It is now almost certain that there is a\\ngreat oxidized northward-creeping current which flows out of the\\nAntarctic Ocean and under the waters of the other great oceans of the\\nworld.\\nIt was the good fortune of Ross, at a time when the fringes of the great\\nAntarctic continent were being discovered in comparatively low latitudes\\nof 66\xb0 and thereabouts, sometimes not even within the Antarctic Circle,\\nto find to the south of New Zealand a deep inlet in which he could sail\\nto the high latitude of 78\xb0. This inlet, which is now known as the Ross\\nSea, has formed the starting-place of all sledging parties which have\\napproached the South Pole. I have dwelt upon this description of the\\nlands he discovered because they will come very intimately into this\\nhistory. I have also emphasized his importance in the history of\\nAntarctic exploration because Ross having done what it was possible to do\\nby sea, penetrating so far south and making such memorable discoveries,\\nthe next necessary step in Antarctic exploration was that another\\ntraveller should follow up his work on land. It is an amazing thing that\\nsixty years were allowed to elapse before that traveller appeared. When\\nhe appeared he was Scott. In the sixty years which elapsed between Ross\\nand Scott the map of the Antarctic remained practically unaltered. Scott\\ntackled the land, and Scott is the Father of Antarctic sledge travelling.\\nThis period of time saw a great increase in the interest taken in science\\nboth pure and applied, and it had been pointed out in 1893 that \\"we knew\\nmore about the planet Mars than about a large area of our own globe.\\" The\\nChallenger Expedition of 1874 had spent three weeks within the Antarctic\\nCircle, and the specimens brought home by her from the depths of these\\ncold seas had aroused curiosity. Meanwhile Borchgrevink (1897) landed at\\nCape Adare, and built a hut which still stands and which afforded our\\nCape Adare party valuable assistance. Here he lived during the first\\nwinter which men spent in the Antarctic.\\nMeanwhile, in the Arctic, brave work was being done. The names of Parry,\\nM\'Clintock, Franklin, Markham, Nares, Greely and De Long are but a few of\\nthe many which suggest themselves of those who have fought their way mile\\nby mile over rough ice and open leads with appliances which now seem to\\nbe primitive and with an addition to knowledge which often seemed hardly\\ncommensurate with the hardships suffered and the disasters which\\nsometimes overtook them. To those whose fortune it has been to serve\\nunder Scott the Franklin Expedition has more than ordinary interest, for\\nit was the same ships, the Erebus and Terror, which discovered Ross\\nIsland, that were crushed in the northern ice after Franklin himself had\\ndied, and it was Captain Crozier (the same Crozier who was Ross\'s captain\\nin the South and after whom Cape Crozier is named) who then took command\\nand led that most ghastly journey in all the history of exploration: more\\nwe shall never know, for none survived to tell the tale. Now, with the\\nnoise and racket of London all round them, a statue of Scott looks across\\nto one of Franklin and his men of the Erebus and Terror, and surely they\\nhave some thoughts in common.","image":"C00.03.png"},{"merge":"C00.04","output":"1.

For this purpose the\\nmost famous of Arctic ships was built, called the Fram. She was designed\\nby Colin Archer, and was saucer-shaped, with a breadth one-third of her\\ntotal length. With most of the expert Arctic opinion against him, Nansen\\nbelieved that this ship would rise and sit on the top of the ice when\\npressed, instead of being crushed. Of her wonderful voyage with her\\nthirteen men, of how she was frozen into the ice in September 1893 in the\\nnorth of Siberia (79\xb0 N.) and of the heaving and trembling of the ship\\namidst the roar of the ice pressure, of how the Fram rose to the occasion\\nas she was built to do, the story has still, after twenty-eight years,\\nthe thrill of novelty. She drifted over the eightieth degree on February\\n2, 1894. During the first winter Nansen was already getting restive: the\\ndrift was so slow, and sometimes it was backwards: it was not until the\\nsecond autumn that the eighty-second degree arrived. So he decided that\\nhe would make an attempt to penetrate northwards by sledging during the\\nfollowing spring. As Nansen has told me, he felt that the ship would do\\nher job in any case. Could not something more be done also?\\nThis was one of the bravest decisions a polar explorer has ever taken. It\\nmeant leaving a drifting ship which could not be regained: it meant a\\nreturn journey over drifting ice to land; the nearest known land was\\nnearly five hundred miles south of the point from which he started\\nnorthwards; and the journey would include travelling both by sea and by\\nice.\\nUndoubtedly there was more risk in leaving the Fram than in remaining in\\nher. It is a laughable absurdity to say, as Greely did after Nansen\'s\\nalmost miraculous return, that he had deserted his men in an ice-beset\\nship, and deserved to be censured for doing so.[13] The ship was left in\\nthe command of Sverdrup. Johansen was chosen to be Nansen\'s one\\ncompanion, and we shall hear of him again in the Fram, this time with\\nAmundsen in his voyage to the South.\\nThe polar traveller is so interested in the adventure and hardships of\\nNansen\'s sledge journey that his equipment, which is the most important\\nside of his expedition to us who have gone South, is liable to be\\noverlooked. The modern side of polar travel begins with Nansen. It was\\nNansen who first used a light sledge based upon the ski sledge of Norway,\\nin place of the old English heavy sledge which was based upon the Eskimo\\ntype. Cooking apparatus, food, tents, clothing and the thousand and one\\ndetails of equipment without which no journey nowadays stands much chance\\nof success, all date back to Nansen in the immediate past, though beyond\\nhim of course is the experience of centuries of travellers. As Nansen\\nhimself wrote of the English polar men: \\"How well was their equipment\\nthought out and arranged with the means they had at their disposal!\\nTruly, there is nothing new under the sun. Most of what I prided myself\\nupon, and what I thought to be new, I find they had anticipated.\\nM\'Clintock used the same things forty years ago. It was not their fault\\nthat they were born in a country where the use of snowshoes is\\nunknown....\\"[14]\\nAll the more honour to the men who dared so much and travelled so far\\nwith the limited equipment of the past. The real point for us is that,\\njust as Scott is the Father of Antarctic sledge travelling, so Nansen may\\nbe considered the modern Father of it all.\\nNansen and Johansen started on March 14 when the Fram was in latitude 84\xb0\\n4\xb4 N., and the sun had only returned a few days before, with three\\nsledges (two of which carried kayaks) and 28 dogs. They reached their\\nnorthern-most camp on April 8, which Nansen has given in his book as\\nbeing in latitude 86\xb0 13.6\xb4 N. But Nansen tells me that Professor\\nGeelmuyden, who had his astronomical results and his diary, reckoned that\\nowing to refraction the horizon was lifted, and if so the observation had\\nto be reduced accordingly. Nansen therefore gave the reduced latitude in\\nhis book, but he considers that his horizon was very clear when he took\\nthat observation, and believes that his latitude was higher than that\\ngiven. He used a sextant and the natural horizon.\\nThey turned, and travelling back round pressed-up ice and open leads they\\nfailed to find the land they had been led to expect in latitude 83\xb0,\\nwhich indeed was proved to be non-existent. At the end of June they\\nstarted using the kayaks, which needed many repairs after their rough\\npassage, to cross the open leads. They waited long in camp, that the\\ntravelling conditions might improve, and all the time Nansen saw a white\\nspot he thought was cloud. At last, on July 24, land was in sight, which\\nproved to be that white spot. Fourteen days later they reached it to find\\nthat it consisted of a series of islands. These they left behind them\\nand, unable to say what land they had reached, for their watches had run\\ndown, they coasted on westwards and southwards until winter approached.\\nThey built a hut of moss and stones and snow, and roofed it with walrus\\nskins cut from the animals while they lay in the sea, for they were too\\nheavy for two men to drag on to the ice. When I met Nansen he had\\nforgotten all about this, and would not believe that it had happened\\nuntil he saw it in his own book. They lay in their old clothes that\\nwinter, so soaked with blubber that the only way to clean their shirts\\nwas to scrape them. They made themselves new clothes from blankets, and\\nsleeping-bags from the skins of the bears which they ate, and started\\nagain in May of the following year to make Spitzbergen. They had been\\ntravelling a long month, during which time they had at least two very\\nnarrow escapes--the first due to their kayaks floating away, when Nansen\\nswam out into the icy sea and reached them just before he sank, and\\nJohansen passed the worst moments of his life watching from the shore;\\nthe second caused by the attack of a walrus which went for Nansen\'s kayak\\nwith tusks and flippers. And then one morning, as he looked round at the\\ncold glaciers and naked cliffs, not knowing where he was, he heard a dog\\nbark. Intensely excited, he started towards the sound, to be met by the\\nleader of the English Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition whose party was\\nwintering there, and who first gave him the definite news that he was on\\nFranz Josef Land. Nansen and Johansen were finally landed at Vardo in the\\nnorth of Norway, to learn that no tidings had yet been heard of the Fram.\\nThat very day she cleared the ice which had imprisoned her for nearly\\nthree years.\\nI cannot go into the Fram\'s journey save to say that she had drifted as\\nfar north as 85\xb0 55\xb4 N., only eighteen geographical miles south of\\nNansen\'s farthest north. But the sledge journey and the winter spent by\\nthe two men has many points in common with the experience of our own\\nNorthern Party, and often and often during the long winter of 1912 our\\nthoughts turned with hope to Nansen\'s winter, for we said if it had been\\ndone once why should it not be done again, and Campbell and his men\\nsurvive.\\nBefore Nansen started, the spirit of adventure, which has always led men\\ninto the unknown, combined with the increased interest in knowledge for\\nits own sake to turn the thoughts of the civilized world southwards. It\\nwas becoming plain that a continent of the extent and climate which this\\npolar land probably possessed might have an overwhelming influence upon\\nthe weather conditions of the whole Southern Hemisphere. The importance\\nof magnetism was only rivalled by the mystery in which the whole subject\\nwas shrouded: and the region which surrounded the Southern Magnetic Pole\\nof the earth offered a promising field of experiment and observation. The\\npast history, through the ages, of this land was of obvious importance to\\nthe geological story of the earth, whilst the survey of land formations\\nand ice action in the Antarctic was more useful perhaps to the\\nphysiographer than that of any other country in the world, seeing that he\\nfound here in daily and even hourly operation the conditions which he\\nknew had existed in the ice ages of the past over the whole world, but\\nwhich he could only infer from vestigial remains. The biological\\nimportance of the Antarctic might be of the first magnitude in view of\\nthe significance which attaches to the life of the sea in the\\nevolutionary problem.\\nAnd it was with these objects and ideals that Scott\'s first expedition,\\nknown officially as the British Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904, but\\nmore familiarly as \'The Discovery Expedition,\' from the name of the ship\\nwhich carried it, was organized by the Royal Society and the Royal\\nGeographical Society, backed by the active support of the British\\nGovernment. The executive officers and crew were Royal Navy almost\\nwithout exception, whilst the scientific purposes of the expedition were\\nserved in addition by five scientists. These latter were not naval\\nofficers.\\nThe Discovery left New Zealand on Christmas Eve 1901, and entered the\\nbelt of pack ice which always has to be penetrated in order to reach the\\ncomparatively open sea beyond, when just past the Antarctic Circle. But a\\nlittle more than four days saw her through, in which she was lucky, as we\\nnow know. Scott landed at Cape Adare and then coasted down the western\\ncoast of Victoria Land just as Ross had done sixty years before. As he\\nvoyaged south he began to look for safe winter quarters for the ship, and\\nwhen he pushed into McMurdo Sound on January 21, 1902, it seemed that\\nhere he might find both a sheltered bay into which the ship could be\\nfrozen, and a road to the southland beyond.","image":"C00.04.png"},{"merge":"C00.05","output":"Summary: The Discovery Expedition spent the open season exploring the northern limit of the Great Ice Barrier and discovered King Edward VII\'s Land.

Passing the extreme\\neastward position reached by Ross in 1842, they sailed on into an unknown\\nworld, and discovered a deep bay, called Balloon Bight, where the rounded\\nsnow-covered slopes undoubtedly were land and not, as heretofore,\\nfloating ice. Farther east, as they sailed, shallow soundings and gentle\\nsnow slopes gave place to steeper and more broken ridges, until at last\\nsmall black patches in the snow gave undoubted evidence of rock; and an\\nundiscovered land, now known as King Edward VII.\'s Land, rose to a height\\nof several thousand feet. The presence of thick pack ahead, and the\\nadvance of the season, led Scott to return to McMurdo Sound, where he\\nanchored the Discovery in a little bay at the end of the tongue of land\\nnow known as the Hut Point Peninsula, and built the hut which, though\\nlittle used in the Discovery days, was to figure so largely in the story\\nof this his last expedition.\\nThe first autumn was spent in various short journeys of\\ndiscovery--discovery not only of the surrounding land but of many\\nmistakes in sledging equipment and routine. It is amazing to one who\\nlooks back upon these first efforts of the Discovery Expedition that the\\nresults were not more disastrous than was actually the case. When one\\nreads of dog-teams which refused to start, of pemmican which was\\nconsidered to be too rich to eat, of two officers discussing the ascent\\nof Erebus and back in one day, and of sledging parties which knew neither\\nhow to use their cookers or lamp, nor how to put up their tents, nor even\\nhow to put on their clothes, then one begins to wonder that the process\\nof education was gained at so small a price. \\"Not a single article of the\\noutfit had been tested; and amid the general ignorance that prevailed the\\nlack of system was painfully apparent in everything.\\"[15]\\nThis led to a tragedy. A returning sledge party of men was overtaken by a\\nblizzard on the top of the Peninsula near Castle Rock. They quite\\nproperly camped, and should have been perfectly comfortable lying in\\ntheir sleeping-bags after a hot meal. But the primus lamps could not be\\nlighted, and as they sat in leather boots and inadequate clothing being\\ncontinually frost-bitten they decided to leave the tent and make their\\nway to the ship--sheer madness as we now know. As they groped their way\\nin the howling snow-drift the majority of the party either slipped or\\nrolled down a steep slippery snow slope some thousand feet high ending in\\na precipitous ice-cliff, below which lay the open sea. It is a nasty\\nplace on a calm summer day: in a blizzard it must be ghastly. Yet only\\none man, named Vince, shot down the slope and over the precipice into the\\nsea below. How the others got back heaven knows. One seaman called Hare,\\nwho separated from the others and lay down under a rock, awoke after\\nthirty-six hours, covered with snow but in full possession of his\\nfaculties and free from frost-bites. The little cross at Hut Point\\ncommemorates the death of Vince. One of this party was a seaman called\\nWild, who came to the front and took the lead of five of the survivors\\nafter the death of Vince. He was to take the lead often in future\\nexpeditions under Shackleton and Mawson, and there are few men living\\nwho have so proved themselves as polar travellers.\\nI have dwelt upon this side of the early sledging deficiencies of the\\nDiscovery to show the importance of experience in Antarctic land\\ntravelling, whether it be at first or second hand. Scott and his men in\\n1902 were pioneers. They bought their experience at a price which might\\neasily have been higher; and each expedition which has followed has added\\nto the fund. The really important thing is that nothing of what is gained\\nshould be lost. It is one of the main objects of this book to hand on as\\ncomplete a record as possible of the methods, equipment, food and weights\\nused by Scott\'s Last Expedition for the use of future explorers. \\"The\\nfirst object of writing an account of a Polar voyage is the guidance of\\nfuture voyagers: the first duty of the writer is to his successors.\\"[16]\\nThe adaptability, invention and resource of the men of the Discovery when\\nthey set to work after the failures of the autumn to prepare for the\\nsuccesses of the two following summers showed that they could rise to\\ntheir difficulties. Scott admitted that \\"food, clothing, everything was\\nwrong, the whole system was bad.\\"[17] In determining to profit by his\\nmistakes, and working out a complete system of Antarctic travel, he was\\nat his best; and it was after a winter of drastic reorganization that he\\nstarted on November 2, 1902, on his first southern journey with two\\ncompanions, Wilson and Shackleton.\\nIt is no part of my job to give an account of this journey. The dogs\\nfailed badly: probably the Norwegian stock-fish which had been brought\\nthrough the tropics to feed them was tainted: at any rate they sickened;\\nand before the journey was done all the dogs had to be killed or had\\ndied. A fortnight after starting, the party was relaying--that is, taking\\non part of their load and returning for the rest; and this had to be\\ncontinued for thirty-one days.\\n[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE DOGS--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nThe ration of food was inadequate and they became very hungry as time\\nwent on; but it was not until December 21 that Wilson disclosed to\\nScott that Shackleton had signs of scurvy which had been present for some\\ntime. On December 30, in latitude 82\xb0 16\xb4 S., they decided to return. By\\nthe middle of January the scurvy signs were largely increased and\\nShackleton was seriously ill and spitting blood. His condition became\\nmore and more alarming, and he collapsed on January 18, but revived\\nafterwards. Sometimes walking by the sledge, sometimes being carried upon\\nit, Shackleton survived: Scott and Wilson saved his life. The three men\\nreached the ship on February 3, after covering 960 statute miles in 93\\ndays. Scott and Wilson were both extremely exhausted and seriously\\naffected by scurvy. It was a fine journey, the geographical results of\\nwhich comprised the survey of some three hundred miles of new coast-line,\\nand a further knowledge of the Barrier upon which they travelled.\\nWhile Scott was away southwards an organized attempt was made to discover\\nthe nature of the mountains and glaciers which lay across the Sound to\\nthe west. This party actually reached the plateau which lay beyond, and\\nattained a height of 8900 feet, when \\"as far as they could see in every\\ndirection to the westward of them there extended a level plateau, to the\\nsouth and north could be seen isolated nunataks, and behind them showed\\nthe high mountains which they had passed\\": a practicable road to the west\\nhad been found.\\nI need note no more than these two most important of the many journeys\\ncarried out this season: nor is it necessary for me to give any account\\nof the continuous and fertile scientific work which was accomplished in\\nthis virgin land. In the meantime a relief ship, the Morning, had\\narrived. It was intended that the Discovery should return this year as\\nsoon as the sea-ice in which she was imprisoned should break up and set\\nher free. As February passed, however, it became increasingly plain that\\nthe ice conditions were altogether different from those of the previous\\nyear. On the 8th the Morning was still separated from the Discovery by\\neight miles of fast ice. March 2 was fully late for a low-powered ship to\\nremain in the Sound, and on this date the Morning left. By March 13 all\\nhope of the Discovery being freed that year was abandoned.\\nThe second winter passed much as the first, and as soon as spring arrived\\nsledging was continued. These spring journeys on the Barrier, with\\nsunlight only by day and low temperatures at all times, entailed great\\ndiscomfort and, perhaps worse, want of sleep, frost-bites, and a fast\\naccumulation of moisture in all one\'s clothing and in the sleeping-bags,\\nwhich resulted in masses of ice which had to be thawed out by the heat of\\none\'s body before any degree of comfort could be gained. A fortnight was\\nconsidered about the extreme limit of time for such a journey, and\\ngenerally parties were not absent so long; for at this time a spring\\njourney was considered a dreadful experience. \\"Wait till you\'ve had a\\nspring journey\\" was the threat of the old stagers to us. A winter journey\\nlasting nearly three times as long as a spring journey was not imagined.\\nI advise explorers to be content with imagining it in the future.","image":"C00.05.png"},{"merge":"C00.06","output":"{\\"summary\\": \\"Scott, Evans, and Lashly explore westward into the interior of the plateau, facing difficulties with climate and sledging, and miraculously find their own glacier; Wilson and his companions document the Emperor penguins with whom they have become familiar.\\", \\"excerpt_1\\": \\"They turned homewards on December 1, but found the pulling very heavy; and their difficulties were increased by their ignorance of their exact position.\\", \\"excerpt_2\\": \\"The Emperor penguin is a bird which cannot fly, lives on fish which it catches in the sea, and never steps on land even to breed.\\", \\"text_to_image\\": \\"Emperor penguins standing in a line on a piece of ice in the Ross Sea, with open water behind them and additional penguins visible in the distance.\\"}","parsed":{"summary":"Scott, Evans, and Lashly explore westward into the interior of the plateau, facing difficulties with climate and sledging, and miraculously find their own glacier; Wilson and his companions document the Emperor penguins with whom they have become familiar.","excerpt_1":"They turned homewards on December 1, but found the pulling very heavy; and their difficulties were increased by their ignorance of their exact position.","excerpt_2":"The Emperor penguin is a bird which cannot fly, lives on fish which it catches in the sea, and never steps on land even to breed.","text_to_image":"Emperor penguins standing in a line on a piece of ice in the Ross Sea, with open water behind them and additional penguins visible in the distance."},"passage":"The hardest journey of this year was carried out by Scott with two seamen\\nof whom much will be written in this history. Their names are Edgar Evans\\nand Lashly. The object of the journey was to explore westwards into the\\ninterior of the plateau. By way of the Ferrar Glacier they reached the\\nice-cap after considerable troubles, not the least of which was the loss\\nof the data necessary for navigation contained in an excellent\\npublication called Hints to Travellers, which was blown away. Then for\\nthe first time it was seen what additional difficulties are created by\\nthe climate and position of this lofty plateau, which we now know extends\\nover the Pole and probably reaches over the greater part of the Antarctic\\ncontinent. It was the beginning of November: that is, the beginning of\\nsummer; but the conditions of work were much the same as those found\\nduring the spring journeys on the Barrier. The temperature dropped into\\nthe minus forties; but the worst feature of all was a continuous\\nhead-wind blowing from west to east which combined with the low\\ntemperature and rarefied air to make the conditions of sledging\\nextremely laborious. The supporting party returned, and the three men\\ncontinued alone, pulling out westwards into an unknown waste of snow with\\nno landmarks to vary the rough monotony. They turned homewards on\\nDecember 1, but found the pulling very heavy; and their difficulties were\\nincreased by their ignorance of their exact position. The few glimpses of\\nthe land which they obtained as they approached it in the thick weather\\nwhich prevailed only left them in horrible uncertainty as to their\\nwhereabouts. Owing to want of food it was impossible to wait for the\\nweather to clear: there was nothing to be done but to continue their\\neastward march. Threading their way amidst the ice disturbances which\\nmark the head of the glaciers, the party pushed blindly forward in air\\nwhich was becoming thick with snow-drift. Suddenly Lashly slipped: in a\\nmoment the whole party was flying downwards with increasing speed. They\\nceased to slide smoothly; they were hurled into the air and descended\\nwith great force on to a gradual snow incline. Rising they looked round\\nthem to find above them an ice-fall 300 feet high down which they had\\nfallen: above it the snow was still drifting, but where they stood there\\nwas peace and blue sky. They recognized now for the first time their own\\nglacier and the well-remembered landmark, and far away in the distance\\nwas the smoking summit of Mount Erebus. It was a miracle.\\nExcellent subsidiary journeys were also made of which space allows no\\nmention here: nor do they bear directly upon this last expedition. But in\\nview of the Winter Journey undertaken by us, if not for the interest of\\nthe subject itself, some account must be given of those most aristocratic\\ninhabitants of the Antarctic, the Emperor penguins, with whom Wilson and\\nhis companions in the Discovery now became familiar.\\nThere are two kinds of Antarctic penguins--the little Ad\xe9lie with his\\nblue-black coat and his white shirt-front, weighing 16 lbs., an object of\\nendless pleasure and amusement, and the great dignified Emperor with long\\ncurved beak, bright orange head-wear and powerful flippers, a\\npersonality of 6\xbd stones. Science singles out the Emperor as being the\\nmore interesting bird because he is more primitive, possibly the most\\nprimitive of all birds. Previous to the Discovery Expedition nothing was\\nknown of him save that he existed in the pack and on the fringes of the\\ncontinent.\\nWe have heard of Cape Crozier as being the eastern extremity of Ross\\nIsland, discovered by Ross and named after the captain of the Terror. It\\nis here that with immense pressures and rendings the moving sheet of the\\nBarrier piles itself up against the mountain. It is here also that the\\ngreat ice-cliff which runs for hundreds of miles to the east, with the\\nBarrier behind it and the Ross Sea beating into its crevasses and caves,\\njoins the basalt precipice which bounds the Knoll, as the two-knobbed\\nsaddle which forms Cape Crozier is called. Altogether it is the kind of\\nplace where giants have had a good time in their childhood, playing with\\nice instead of mud--so much cleaner too!\\nBut the slopes of Mount Terror do not all end in precipices. Farther to\\nthe west they slope quietly into the sea, and the Ad\xe9lie penguins have\\ntaken advantage of this to found here one of their largest and most\\nsmelly rookeries. When the Discovery arrived off this rookery she sent a\\nboat ashore and set up a post with a record upon it to guide the relief\\nship in the following year. The post still stands. Later it became\\ndesirable to bring the record left here more up to date, and so one of\\nthe first sledging parties went to try and find a way by the Barrier to\\nthis spot.\\nThey were prevented from reaching the record by a series of most violent\\nblizzards, and indeed Cape Crozier is one of the windiest places on\\nearth, but they proved beyond doubt that a back-door to the Ad\xe9lie\\npenguins\' rookery existed by way of the slopes of Mount Terror behind the\\nKnoll. Early the next year another party reached the record all right,\\nand while exploring the neighbourhood looked down over the 800-feet\\nprecipice which forms the snout of Cape Crozier. The sea was frozen over,\\nand in a small bay of ice formed by the cliffs of the Barrier below were\\nnumerous little dots which resolved themselves into Emperor penguins.\\nCould this be the breeding-place of these wonderful birds? If so, they\\nmust nurse their eggs in mid-winter, in unimagined cold and darkness.\\nFive days more elapsed before further investigation could be made, for a\\nviolent blizzard kept the party in their tents. On October 18 they set\\nout to climb the high pressure ridges which lie between the level barrier\\nand the sea. They found that their conjectures were right: there was the\\ncolony of Emperors. Several were nursing chicks, but all the ice in the\\nRoss Sea was gone; only the small bay of ice remained. The number of\\nadult birds was estimated at four hundred, the number of living chicks\\nwas thirty, and there were some eighty dead ones. No eggs were found.[18]\\nSeveral more journeys were made to this spot while the Discovery was in\\nthe south, generally in the spring; and the sum total of the information\\ngained came to something like this. The Emperor is a bird which cannot\\nfly, lives on fish which it catches in the sea, and never steps on land\\neven to breed. For a reason which was not then understood it lays its\\neggs upon the bare ice some time during the winter and carries out the\\nwhole process of incubation on the sea ice, resting the egg upon its feet\\npressed closely to a patch of bare skin in the lower abdomen, and\\nprotected from the intense cold by a loose falling lappet of skin and\\nfeathers. By September 12, the earliest date upon which a party arrived,\\nall the eggs which were not broken or addled were hatched, and there were\\nthen about a thousand adult Emperors in the rookery. Arriving again on\\nOctober 19, a party experienced a ten days\' blizzard which confined them\\nduring seven days to their tents, but during their windy visit they saw\\none of the most interesting scenes in natural history. The story must be\\ntold by Wilson, who was there:\\n\\"The day before the storm broke we were on an old outlying cone of Mount\\nTerror, about 1300 feet above the sea. Below us lay the Emperor penguin\\nrookery on the bay ice, and Ross Sea, completely frozen over, was a\\nplain of firm white ice to the horizon. There was not even the lane of\\nopen water which usually runs along the Barrier cliff stretching away as\\nit does like a winding thread to the east and out of sight. No space or\\ncrack could be seen with open water. Nevertheless the Emperors were\\nunsettled owing, there can be no doubt, to the knowledge that bad weather\\nwas impending. The mere fact that the usual canal of open water was not\\nto be seen along the face of the Barrier meant that the ice in Ross Sea\\nhad a southerly drift. This in itself was unusual, and was caused by a\\nnortherly wind with snow, the precursor here of a storm from the\\nsouth-west. The sky looked black and threatening, the barometer began to\\nfall, and before long down came snowflakes on the upper heights of Mount\\nTerror.\\n\\"All these warnings were an open book to the Emperor penguins, and if one\\nknew the truth there probably were many others too. They were in\\nconsequence unsettled, and although the ice had not yet started moving\\nthe Emperor penguins had; a long file was moving out from the bay to the\\nopen ice, where a pack of some one or two hundred had already collected\\nabout two miles out at the edge of a refrozen crack. For an hour or more\\nthat afternoon we watched this exodus proceeding, and returned to camp,\\nmore than ever convinced that bad weather might be expected. Nor were we\\ndisappointed, for on the next day we woke to a southerly gale and smother\\nof snow and drift, which effectually prevented any one of us from leaving\\nour camp at all. This continued without intermission all day and night\\ntill the following morning, when the weather cleared sufficiently to\\nallow us to reach the edge of the cliff which overlooked the rookery.\\n[Illustration: THE EMPERORS ROOKERY]\\n\\"The change here was immense. Ross Sea was open water for nearly thirty\\nmiles; a long line of white pack ice was just visible on the horizon from\\nwhere we stood, some 800 to 900 feet above the sea. Large sheets of ice\\nwere still going out and drifting to the north, and the migration of the\\nEmperors was in full swing. There were again two companies waiting on\\nthe ice at the actual water\'s edge, with some hundred more tailing out in\\nsingle file to join them. The birds were waiting far out at the edge of\\nthe open water, as far as it was possible for them to walk, on a\\nprojecting piece of ice, the very next piece that would break away and\\ndrift to the north. The line of tracks in the snow along which the birds\\nhad gone the day before was now cut off short at the edge of the open\\nwater, showing that they had gone, and under the ice-cliffs there was an\\nappreciable diminution in the number of Emperors left, hardly more than\\nhalf remaining of all that we had seen there six days before.\\"[19]\\nTwo days later the emigration was still in full swing, but only the\\nunemployed seemed to have gone as yet. Those who were nursing chicks were\\nstill huddled under the ice-cliffs, sheltered as much as possible from\\nthe storm. Three days later (October 28) no ice was to be seen in the\\nRoss Sea: the little bay of ice was gradually being eaten away: the same\\nexodus was in progress and only a remnant of penguins was still left.","image":"C00.06.png"},{"merge":"C00.07","output":"The passage describes the difficulty of studying the embryology of Emperor penguins and the challenges faced by Scott and his team, including their struggle to free their ship from the ice.

As Wilson wrote:\\n\\"The possibility that we have in the Emperor penguin the nearest approach\\nto a primitive form not only of a penguin but of a bird makes the future\\nworking out of its embryology a matter of the greatest possible\\nimportance. It was a great disappointment to us that although we\\ndiscovered their breeding-ground, and although we were able to bring home\\na number of deserted eggs and chicks, we were not able to procure a\\nseries of early embryos by which alone the points of particular interest\\ncan be worked out. To have done this in a proper manner from the spot at\\nwhich the Discovery wintered in McMurdo Sound would have involved us in\\nendless difficulties, for it would have entailed the risks of sledge\\ntravelling in mid-winter with an almost total absence of light. It would\\nat any time require that a party of three at least, with full camp\\nequipment, should traverse about a hundred miles of the Barrier surface\\nin the dark and should, by moonlight, cross over with rope and axe the\\nimmense pressure ridges which form a chaos of crevasses at Cape Crozier.\\nThese ridges, moreover, which have taken a party as much as two hours of\\ncareful work to cross by daylight, must be crossed and re-crossed at\\nevery visit to the breeding site in the bay. There is no possibility even\\nby daylight of conveying over them the sledge or camping kit, and in the\\ndarkness of mid-winter the impracticability is still more obvious. Cape\\nCrozier is a focus for wind and storm, where every breath is converted,\\nby the configuration of Mounts Erebus and Terror, into a regular drifting\\nblizzard full of snow. It is here, as I have already stated, that on one\\njourney or another we have had to lie patiently in sodden sleeping-bags\\nfor as many as five and seven days on end, waiting for the weather to\\nchange and make it possible for us to leave our tents at all. If,\\nhowever, these dangers were overcome there would still be the difficulty\\nof making the needful preparations from the eggs. The party would have to\\nbe on the scene at any rate early in July. Supposing that no eggs were\\nfound upon arrival, it would be well to spend the time in labelling the\\nmost likely birds, those for example that have taken up their stations\\nclose underneath the ice-cliffs. And if this were done it would be easier\\nthen to examine them daily by moonlight, if it and the weather generally\\nwere suitable: conditions, I must confess, not always easily obtained at\\nCape Crozier. But if by good luck things happened to go well, it would by\\nthis time be useful to have a shelter built of snow blocks on the sea-ice\\nin which to work with the cooking lamp to prevent the freezing of the egg\\nbefore the embryo was cut out, and in order that fluid solutions might\\nbe handy for the various stages of its preparation; for it must be borne\\nin mind that the temperature all the while may be anything between zero\\nand -50\xb0 F. The whole work no doubt would be full of difficulty, but it\\nwould not be quite impossible, and it is with a view to helping those to\\nwhom the opportunity may occur in future that this outline has been added\\nof the difficulties that would surely beset their path.\\"[20]\\nWe shall meet the Emperor penguins again, but now we must go back to the\\nDiscovery, lying off Hut Point, with the season advancing and twenty\\nmiles of ice between her and the open sea. The prospects of getting out\\nthis year seeming almost less promising than those of the last year, an\\nabortive attempt was made to saw a channel from a half-way point. Still,\\nlife to Scott and Wilson in a tent at Cape Royds was very pleasant after\\nsledging, and the view of the blue sea framed in the tent door was very\\nbeautiful on a morning in January when two ships sailed into the frame.\\nWhy two? One was of course the Morning; the second proved to be the Terra\\nNova.\\nIt seemed that the authorities at home had been alarmed at the reports\\nbrought back the previous year by the relief ship of the detention of the\\nDiscovery and certain outbreaks of scurvy which had occurred both on the\\nship and on sledge journeys. To make sure of relief two ships had been\\nsent. That was nothing to worry about, but the orders they brought were\\nstaggering to sailors who had come to love their ship \\"with a depth of\\nsentiment which cannot be surprising when it is remembered what we had\\nbeen through in her and what a comfortable home she had proved.\\"[21]\\nScott was ordered to abandon the Discovery if she could not be freed in\\ntime to accompany the relief ships to the north. For weeks there was\\nlittle or no daily change. They started to transport the specimens and\\nmake the other necessary preparations. They almost despaired of freedom.\\nExplosions in the ice were started in the beginning of February with\\nlittle effect. But suddenly there came a change, and on the 11th, amidst\\nintense excitement, the ice was breaking up fast. The next day the relief\\nships were but four miles away. On the 14th a shout of \\"The ships are\\ncoming, sir!\\" brought out all the men racing to the slopes above Arrival\\nBay. Scott wrote:\\n\\"The ice was breaking up right across the Strait, and with a rapidity\\nwhich we had not thought possible. No sooner was one great floe borne\\naway than a dark streak cut its way into the solid sheet that remained,\\nand carved out another, to feed the broad stream of pack which was\\nhurrying away to the north-west.\\n\\"I have never witnessed a more impressive sight; the sun was low behind\\nus, the surface of the ice-sheet in front was intensely white, and in\\ncontrast the distant sea and its leads looked almost black. The wind had\\nfallen to a calm, and not a sound disturbed the stillness about us.\\n\\"Yet in the midst of this peaceful silence was an awful unseen agency\\nrending that great ice-sheet as though it had been naught but the\\nthinnest paper. We knew well by this time the nature of our prison bars;\\nwe had not plodded again and again over those long dreary miles of snow\\nwithout realizing the formidable strength of the great barrier which held\\nus bound; we knew that the heaviest battle-ship would have shattered\\nitself ineffectually against it, and we had seen a million-ton iceberg\\nbrought to rest at its edge. For weeks we had been struggling with this\\nmighty obstacle ... but now without a word, without an effort on our\\npart, it was all melting away, and we knew that in an hour or two not a\\nvestige of it would be left, and that the open sea would be lapping on\\nthe black rocks of Hut Point.\\"[22]\\nAlmost more dramatic was the grounding of the Discovery off the shoal at\\nHut Point owing to the rise of a blizzard immediately after her release\\nfrom the ice. Hour after hour she lay pounding on the shore, and when it\\nseemed most certain that she had been freed only to be destroyed, and\\nwhen all hope was nearly gone, the wind lulled, and the waters of the\\nSound, driven out by the force of the wind, returned and the Discovery\\nfloated off with little damage. The whole story of the release from the\\nice and subsequent grounding of the Discovery is wonderfully told by\\nScott in his book.\\nSome years after this I met Wilson in a shooting lodge in Scotland. He\\nwas working upon grouse disease for the Royal Commission which had been\\nappointed, and I saw then for the first time something of his magnetic\\npersonality and glimpses also of his methods of work. He and Scott both\\nmeant to go back and finish the job, and I then settled that when they\\nwent I would go too if wishing could do anything. Meanwhile Shackleton\\nwas either in the South or making his preparations to go there.\\nHe left England in 1908, and in the following Antarctic summer two\\nwonderful journeys were made. The first, led by Shackleton himself,\\nconsisted of four men and four ponies. Leaving Cape Royds, where the\\nexpedition wintered in a hut, in November, they marched due south on the\\nBarrier outside Scott\'s track until they were stopped by the eastward\\ntrend of the range of mountains, and by the chaotic pressure caused by\\nthe discharge of a Brobdingnagian glacier.\\nBut away from the main stream of the glacier, and separated from it by\\nland now known as Hope Island, was a narrow and steep snow slope forming\\na gateway which opened on to the main glacier stream. Boldly plunging\\nthrough this, the party made its way up the Beardmore Glacier, a giant of\\nits kind, being more than twice as large as any other known. The history\\nof their adventures will make anybody\'s flesh creep. From the top they\\ntravelled due south toward the Pole under the trying conditions of the\\nplateau and reached the high latitude of 88\xb0 23\xb4 S. before they were\\nforced to turn by lack of food.","image":"C00.07.png"},{"merge":"C00.08","output":"The passage describes the Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole, including the Main Party\'s various journeys and the landing of a smaller party under Campbell.

This was a very\\nwonderful journey, and when Shackleton returned in 1909 he and his\\nexpedition had made good. During the same year the North Pole was reached\\nby Peary after some twelve years of travelling in Arctic regions.\\nScott published the plans of his second expedition in 1909. This\\nexpedition is the subject of the present history.\\nThe Terra Nova sailed from the West India Dock, London, on June 1, 1910,\\nand from Cardiff on June 15. She made her way to New Zealand, refitted\\nand restowed her cargo, took on board ponies, dogs, motor sledges,\\ncertain further provisions and equipment, as well as such members of her\\nexecutive officers and scientists as had not travelled out in her, and\\nleft finally for the South on November 29, 1910. She arrived in McMurdo\\nSound on January 4, 1911, and our hut had been built on Cape Evans and\\nall stores landed in less than a fortnight. Shortly afterwards the ship\\nsailed. The party which was left at Cape Evans under Scott is known as\\nthe Main Party.\\nBut the scientific objects of the expedition included the landing of a\\nsecond but much smaller party under Campbell on King Edward VII.\'s Land.\\nWhile returning from an abortive attempt to land here they found a\\nNorwegian expedition under Captain Roald Amundsen in Nansen\'s old ship\\nthe Fram in the Bay of Whales: reference to this expedition will be found\\nelsewhere.[23] One member of Amundsen\'s party was Johansen, the only\\ncompanion of Nansen on his famous Arctic sledge journey, of which a brief\\noutline has been given above.[24] Campbell and his five companions were\\nfinally landed at Cape Adare, and built their hut close to\\nBorchgrevinck\'s old winter quarters.[25] The ship returned to New Zealand\\nunder Pennell: came back to the Antarctic a year later with further\\nequipment and provisions, and again two years later to bring back to\\ncivilization the survivors of the expedition.\\nThe adventures and journeyings of the various members of the Main Party\\nare so numerous and simultaneous that I believe it will help the reader\\nwho approaches this book without previous knowledge of the history of\\nthe expedition to give here a brief summary of the course of events.\\nThose who are familiar already with these facts can easily skip a page or\\ntwo.\\nTwo parties were sent out during the first autumn: the one under Scott to\\nlay a large dep\xf4t on the Barrier for the Polar Journey, and this is\\ncalled the Dep\xf4t Journey; the other to carry out geological work among\\nthe Western Mountains, so called because they form the western side of\\nMcMurdo Sound: this is called the First Geological Journey, and another\\nsimilar journey during the following summer is called the Second\\nGeological Journey.\\nBoth parties joined up at the old Discovery Hut at Hut Point in March\\n1911, and here waited for the sea to freeze a passage northwards to Cape\\nEvans. Meanwhile the men left at Cape Evans were continuing the complex\\nscientific work of the station. All the members of the Main Party were\\nnot gathered together at Cape Evans for the winter until May 12. During\\nthe latter half of the winter a journey was made by three men led by\\nWilson to Cape Crozier to investigate the embryology of the Emperor\\npenguin: this is called the Winter Journey.\\nThe journey to the South Pole absorbed the energies of most of the\\nsledging members during the following summer of 1911-12. The motor party\\nturned back on the Barrier; the dog party at the bottom of the Beardmore\\nGlacier. From this point twelve men went forward. Four of these men under\\nAtkinson returned from the top of the glacier in latitude 85\xb0 3\xb4 S.: they\\nare known as the First Return Party. A fortnight later in latitude 87\xb0\\n32\xb4 S. three more men returned under Lieutenant Evans: these are the\\nSecond Return Party. Five men went forward, Scott, Wilson, Bowers, Oates\\nand Seaman Evans. They reached the Pole on January 17 to find that\\nAmundsen had reached it thirty-four days earlier. They returned 721\\nstatute miles and perished 177 miles from their winter quarters.\\nThe supporting parties got back safely, but Lieutenant Evans was very\\nseriously ill with scurvy. The food necessary for the return of the Polar\\nParty from One Ton Camp had not been taken out at the end of February\\n1912. Evans\' illness caused a hurried reorganization of plans, and I was\\nordered to take out this food with one lad and two dog-teams. This was\\ndone, and the journey may be called the Dog Journey to One Ton Camp.\\nWe must now go back to the six men led by Campbell who were landed at\\nCape Adare in the beginning of 1911. They were much disappointed by the\\nsmall amount of sledge work which they were able to do in the summer of\\n1911-1912, for the sea-ice in front of them was blown out early in the\\nyear, and they were unable to find a way up through the mountains behind\\nthem on to the plateau. Therefore, when the Terra Nova appeared on\\nJanuary 4, it was decided that she should land them with six weeks\'\\nsledging rations and some extra biscuits, pemmican and general food near\\nMount Melbourne at Evans Coves, some 250 geographical miles south of Cape\\nAdare, and some 200 geographical miles from our Winter Quarters at Cape\\nEvans. Late on the night of January 8, 1912, they were camped in this\\nspot and saw the last of the ship steaming out of the bay. They had\\narranged to be picked up again on February 18.\\nLet us return to McMurdo Sound. My two dog-teams arrived at Hut Point\\nfrom One Ton Dep\xf4t on March 16 exhausted. The sea-ice was still in from\\nthe Barrier to Hut Point, but from there onwards was open water, and\\ntherefore no communication was possible with Cape Evans. Atkinson, with\\none seaman, was at Hut Point and the situation which he outlined to me on\\narrival was something as follows:\\nThe ship had left and there was now no possibility of her returning owing\\nto the lateness of the season, and she carried in her Lieut. Evans, sick\\nwith scurvy, and five other officers and three men who were returning\\nhome this year. This left only four officers and four men at Cape Evans,\\nin addition to the four of us at Hut Point.\\nThe serious part of the news was that owing to a heavy pack the ship had\\nbeen absolutely unable to reach Campbell\'s party at Evans Coves. Attempt\\nafter attempt had made without success. Would Campbell winter where he\\nwas? Would he try to sledge down the coast?\\nIn the absence of Scott the command of the expedition under the\\nextraordinarily difficult circumstances which arose, both now and during\\nthe coming year, would naturally have devolved upon Lieutenant Evans. But\\nEvans, very sick, was on his way to England. The task fell to Atkinson,\\nand I hope that these pages will show how difficult it was, and how well\\nhe tackled it.\\nThere were now, that is since the arrival of the dog-teams four of us at\\nHut Point; and no help could be got from Cape Evans owing to the open\\nwater which intervened. Two of us were useless for further sledging and\\nthe dogs were absolutely done. As time went on anxiety concerning the\\nnon-arrival of the Polar Party was added to the alarm we already felt\\nabout Campbell and his men; winter was fast closing down, and the weather\\nwas bad. So little could be done by two men. What was to be done? When\\nwas it to be done with the greatest possible chance of success? Added to\\nall his greater anxieties Atkinson had me on his hands--and I was pretty\\nill.\\nIn the end he made two attempts.\\nThe first with one seaman, Keohane, to sledge out on to the Barrier,\\nleaving on March 26. They found the conditions very bad, but reached a\\npoint a few miles south of Corner Camp and returned. Soon after we knew\\nthe Southern Party must be dead.\\nNothing more could be done until communication was effected with Winter\\nQuarters at Cape Evans. This was done by a sledge journey over the newly\\nfrozen ice in the bays on April 10. Help arrived at Hut Point on April\\n14.\\nThe second attempt was then made, and this consisted of a party of four\\nmen who tried to sledge up the Western Coast in order to meet and help\\nCampbell if he was trying to sledge to us.

It was many long months since we had had good news. This was their\\nstory.\\nWhen Campbell originally landed at Evans Coves he brought with him\\nsledging provisions for six weeks, in addition to two weeks\' provisions\\nfor six men, 56 lbs. sugar, 24 lbs. cocoa, 36 lbs. chocolate and 210 lbs.\\nof biscuit, some Oxo and spare clothing. In short, after the sledge work\\nwhich they proposed, and actually carried out, the men were left with\\nskeleton rations for four weeks. They had also a spare tent and an extra\\nsleeping-bag. It was not seriously anticipated that the ship would have\\ngreat difficulty in picking them up in the latter half of February.\\nCampbell\'s party had carried out successful sledging and useful\\ngeological work in the region of Evans Coves. They had then camped on the\\nbeach and looked for the ship to relieve them. There was open water\\nlashed to fury by the wind so far as they could see, and yet she did not\\ncome. They concluded that she must have been wrecked. The actual fact was\\nthat thick pack ice lay beyond their vision through which Pennell was\\ntrying to drive his ship time after time, until he had either to go or to\\nbe frozen in. He never succeeded in approaching nearer than 27 miles.\\nIt was now that a blizzard wind started to blow down from the plateau\\nbehind them out into the continually open sea in front. The situation was\\nbad enough already, but of course such weather conditions made it\\ninfinitely worse. Evans Coves is paved with boulders over which all\\njourneys had to be fought leaning against the wind as it blew: when a\\nlull came the luckless traveller fell forward on to his face. Under these\\ncircumstances it was decided that preparations must be made to winter\\nwhere they were, and to sledge down the coast to Cape Evans in the\\nfollowing spring. The alternative of sledging down the coast in March and\\nApril never seems to have been seriously considered. At Hut Point, of\\ncourse, we were entirely in the dark as to what the party would do, hence\\nAtkinson\'s journey over to the western side in April 1912.\\nMeanwhile the stranded men divided into two parties of three men each.\\nThe first under Campbell sank a shaft six feet down into a large\\nsnow-drift and thence, with pick and shovel, excavated a passage and at\\nthe end of it a cave, twelve feet by nine feet, and five feet six inches\\nhigh. The second under Levick sought out and killed all the seal and\\npenguin they could find, but their supply was pitifully small, and the\\nmen never had a full meal until mid-winter night. One man always had to\\nbe left to look after the tents, which were already so worn and damaged\\nthat it was unsafe to leave them in the wind.\\nBy March 17 the cave was sufficiently advanced for three men to move in.\\nPriestley must tell how this was done, but it should not be supposed that\\nthe weather conditions were in any way abnormal on what they afterwards\\ncalled Inexpressible Island:\\n\\"March 17. 7 P.M. Strong south-west breeze all day, freshening to a full\\ngale at night. We have had an awful day, but have managed to shift\\nenough gear into the cave to live there temporarily. Our tempers have\\nnever been so tried during the whole of our life together, but they have\\nstood the strain pretty successfully.... May I never have such another\\nthree trips as were those to-day. Every time the wind lulled a little I\\nfell over to windward, and at every gust I was pitched to leeward, while\\na dozen times or more I was taken off my feet and dashed against the\\nground or against unfriendly boulders. The other two had equally bad\\ntimes. Dickason hurt his knee and ankle and lost his sheath knife, and\\nCampbell lost a compass and some revolver cartridges in the two trips\\nthey made. Altogether it was lucky we got across at all.\\"[26]\\nIt was a fortunate thing that this wind often blew quite clear without\\nsnowfall or drift. Two days later in the same gale the tent of the other\\nthree men collapsed on top of them at 8 A.M. At 4 P.M. the sun was going\\ndown and they settled to make their way across to their comrades. Levick\\ntells the story as follows:\\n\\"Having done this [securing the remains of the tent, etc.], we started on\\nour journey. This lay, first of all, across half a mile of clear blue\\nice, swept by the unbroken wind, which met us almost straight in the\\nface. We could never stand up, so had to scramble the whole distance on\\n\'all fours,\' lying flat on our bellies in the gusts. By the time we had\\nreached the other side we had had enough. Our faces had been rather badly\\nbitten, and I have a very strong recollection of the men\'s countenances,\\nwhich were a leaden blue, streaked with white patches of frost-bite. Once\\nacross, however, we reached the shelter of some large boulders on the\\nshore of the island, and waited here long enough to thaw out our noses,\\nears, and cheeks. A scramble of another six hundred yards brought us to\\nthe half-finished igloo, into which we found that the rest of the party\\nhad barricaded themselves, and, after a little shouting, they came and\\nlet us in, giving us a warm welcome, and about the most welcome hot meal\\nthat I think any of us had ever eaten.\\"\\n[Illustration: PRIESTLEY AND CAMPBELL]\\nPriestley continues:\\n\\"After the arrival of the evicted party we made hoosh, and as we warmed\\nup from the meal, we cheered up and had one of the most successful\\nsing-songs we had ever had forgetting all our troubles for an hour or\\ntwo. It is a pleasing picture to look back upon now, and, if I close my\\neyes, I can see again the little cave cut out in snow and ice with the\\ntent flapping in the doorway, barely secured by ice-axe and shovel\\narranged crosswise against the side of the shaft. The cave is lighted up\\nwith three or four small blubber lamps, which give a soft yellow light.\\nAt one end lie Campbell, Dickason and myself in our sleeping-bags,\\nresting after the day\'s work, and, opposite to us, on a raised dais\\nformed by a portion of the floor not yet levelled, Levick, Browning and\\nAbbott sit discussing their seal hoosh, while the primus hums cheerily\\nunder the cooker containing the coloured water which served with us\\ninstead of cocoa. As the diners warm up jests begin to fly between the\\nrival tents and the interchange is brisk, though we have the upper hand\\nto-day, having an inexhaustible subject in the recent disaster to their\\ntent, and their forced abandonment of their household gods. Suddenly some\\none starts a song with a chorus, and the noise from the primus is dwarfed\\nimmediately. One by one we go through our favourites, and the concert\\nlasts for a couple of hours. By this time the lamps are getting low, and\\ngradually the cold begins to overcome the effects of the hoosh and the\\ncocoa. One after another the singers begin to shiver, and all thoughts of\\nsong disappear as we realize what we are in for. A night with one one-man\\nbag between two men! There is a whole world of discomfort in the very\\nthought, and no one feels inclined to jest about that for the moment.\\nThose jests will come all right to-morrow when the night is safely past,\\nbut this evening it is anything but a cheery subject of contemplation.\\nThere is no help for it, however, and each of us prepares to take another\\nman in so far as he can.\\"[27]\\nIn such spirit and under very similar conditions this dauntless party\\nset about passing through one of the most horrible winters which God has\\ninvented. They were very hungry, for the wind which kept the sea open\\nalso made the shore almost impossible for seals. There were red-letter\\ndays, however, such as when Browning found and killed a seal, and in its\\nstomach, \\"not too far digested to be still eatable,\\" were thirty-six\\nfish. And what visions of joy for the future. \\"We never again found a\\nseal with an eatable meal inside him, but we were always hoping to do so,\\nand a kill was, therefore, always a gamble. Whenever a seal was sighted\\nin future, some one said, \'Fish!\' and there was always a scramble to\\nsearch the beast first.\\"[28]","image":"C00.09.png"},{"merge":"C00.10","output":"The passage describes the difficulties faced by the Northern Party during their stay on Inexpressible Island, including their reliance on seal and penguin meat and blubber, multiple cases of dysentery and ptomaine poisoning, and the lack of relief leading to depression.

Their clothes\\nand gear were soaked with blubber, and the soot blackened them, their\\nsleeping-bags, cookers, walls and roof, choked their throats and inflamed\\ntheir eyes. Blubbery clothes are cold, and theirs were soon so torn as to\\nafford little protection against the wind, and so stiff with blubber that\\nthey would stand up by themselves, in spite of frequent scrapings with\\nknives and rubbings with penguin skins, and always there were underfoot\\nthe great granite boulders which made walking difficult even in daylight\\nand calm weather. As Levick said, \\"the road to hell might be paved with\\ngood intentions, but it seemed probable that hell itself would be paved\\nsomething after the style of Inexpressible Island.\\"\\nBut there were consolations; the long-waited-for lump of sugar: the\\nsing-songs--and about these there hangs a story. When Campbell\'s Party\\nand the remains of the Main Party forgathered at Cape Evans in November\\n1912, Campbell would give out the hymns for Church. The first Sunday we\\nhad \'Praise the Lord, ye heavens adore Him,\' and the second, and the\\nthird. We suggested a change, to which Campbell asked, \\"Why?\\" We said it\\ngot a bit monotonous. \\"Oh no,\\" said Campbell, \\"we always sang it on\\nInexpressible Island.\\" It was also about the only one he knew. Apart from\\nthis I do not know whether \'Old King Cole\' or the Te Deum was more\\npopular. For reading they had David Copperfield, the Decameron, the Life\\nof Stevenson and a New Testament. And they did Swedish drill, and they\\ngave lectures.\\nTheir worst difficulties were scurvy[29] and ptomaine poisoning, for\\nwhich the enforced diet was responsible. From the first they decided to\\nkeep nearly all their unused rations for sledging down the coast in the\\nfollowing spring, and this meant that they must live till then on the\\nseal and penguin which they could kill. The first dysentery was early in\\nthe winter, and was caused by using the salt from the sea-water. They had\\nsome Cerebos salt, however, in their sledging rations, and used it for a\\nweek, which stopped the disorder and they gradually got used to the\\nsea-ice salt. Browning, however, who had had enteric fever in the past,\\nhad dysentery almost continually right through the winter. Had he not\\nbeen the plucky, cheerful man he is, he would have died.\\nIn June again there was another bad attack of dysentery. Another thing\\nwhich worried them somewhat was the \'igloo back,\' a semi-permanent kink\\ncaused by seldom being able to stand upright.\\nThen, in the beginning of September, they had ptomaine poisoning from\\nmeat which had been too long in what they called the oven, which was a\\nbiscuit box, hung over the blubber stove, into which they placed the\\nfrozen meat to thaw it out. This oven was found to be not quite level,\\nand in a corner a pool of old blood, water and scraps of meat had\\ncollected. This and a tainted hoosh which they did not have the strength\\nof mind to throw away in their hungry condition, seems to have caused the\\noutbreak, which was severe. Browning and Dickason were especially bad.\\nThey had their bad days: those first days of realization that they would\\nnot be relieved: days of depression, disease and hunger, all at once:\\nwhen the seal seemed as if they would give out and they were thinking\\nthey would have to travel down the coast in the winter--but Abbott killed\\ntwo seals with a greasy knife, losing the use of three fingers in the\\nprocess, and saved the situation.\\nBut they also had their good, or less-bad, days: such was mid-winter\\nnight when they held food in their hands and did not want to eat it, for\\nthey were full: or when they got through the Te Deum without a hitch: or\\nwhen they killed some penguins; or got a ration of mustard plaster from\\nthe medical stores.\\nNever was a more cheerful or good-tempered party. They set out to see the\\nhumorous side of everything, and, if they could not do so one day, at any\\nrate they determined to see to it the next. What is more they succeeded,\\nand I have never seen a company of better welded men than that which\\njoined us for those last two months in McMurdo Sound.\\nOn September 30 they started home--so they called it. This meant a sledge\\njourney of some two hundred miles along the coast, and its possibility\\ndepended upon the presence of sea-ice, which we have seen to have been\\nabsent at Evans Coves. It also meant crossing the Drygalski Ice Tongue,\\nan obstacle which bulked very formidably in their imaginations during the\\nwinter. They reached the last rise of this glacier in the evening of\\nOctober 10, and then saw Erebus, one hundred and fifty miles off. The\\nigloo and the past were behind: Cape Evans and the future were in\\nfront--and the sea-ice was in as far as they could see.\\nDickason was half crippled with dysentery when they started, but\\nimproved. Browning, however, was still very ill, but now they were able\\nto eat a ration of four biscuits a day and a small amount of pemmican and\\ncocoa which gave him a better chance than the continual meat. As they\\nneared Granite Harbour, a month after starting, his condition was so\\nserious that they discussed leaving him there with Levick until they\\ncould get medicine and suitable food from Cape Evans.\\nBut their troubles were nearly over, for on reaching Cape Roberts they\\nsuddenly sighted the dep\xf4t left by Taylor in the previous year. They\\nsearched round, like dogs, scratching in the drifts, and found--a whole\\ncase of biscuits: and there were butter and raisins and lard. Day and\\nnight merged into one long lingering feast, and when they started on\\nagain their mouths were sore[30] with eating biscuits. More, there is\\nlittle doubt that the change of diet saved Browning\'s life. As they moved\\ndown the coast they found another dep\xf4t, and yet another. They reached\\nHut Point on November 5.\\nThe story of this, our Northern Party, has been told in full by the two\\nmen most able to tell it: by Campbell in the second volume of Scott\'s\\nbook, by Priestley in a separate volume called Antarctic Adventure.[31] I\\nhave added only these few pages because, save in so far as their\\nadventures touch the Main Party or the Ship, it is better that I should\\nrefer the reader to these two accounts than that I should try and write\\nagain at second hand what has been already twice told. I will only say\\nhere that the history of what these men did and suffered has been\\novershadowed by the more tragic tale of the Polar Party. They are not men\\nwho wish for public applause, but that is no reason why the story of a\\ngreat adventure should not be known; indeed, it is all the more reason\\nwhy it should be known. To those who have not read it I recommend\\nPriestley\'s book mentioned above, or Campbell\'s equally modest account in\\nScott\'s Last Expedition.[32]\\nThe Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans on January 18, 1913, just as we had\\nstarted to prepare for another year. And so the remains of the expedition\\ncame home that spring. Scott\'s book was published in the autumn.\\nThe story of Scott\'s Last Expedition of 1910-13 is a book of two volumes,\\nthe first volume of which is Scott\'s personal diary of the expedition,\\nwritten from day to day before he turned into his sleeping-bag for the\\nnight when sledging, or in the intervals of the many details of\\norganization and preparation in the hut, when at Winter Quarters. The\\nreaders of this book will probably have read that diary and the accounts\\nof the Winter Journey, the last year, the adventures of Campbell\'s Party\\nand the travels of the Terra Nova which follow. With an object which I\\nwill explain presently I quote a review of Scott\'s book from the pen of\\none of Mr. Punch\'s staff:[33]","image":"C00.10.png"},{"merge":"C00.11","output":"The passage describes the importance of recording scientific data and the various books written about the South Pole Expedition.

That story begins in November 1910, and ends on March\\n29, 1912, and it is because when you come to the end, you will have lived\\nwith Scott for sixteen months, that you will not be able to read the last\\npages without tears. That message to the public was heartrending enough\\nwhen it first came to us, but it was as the story of how a great hero\\nfell that we read it; now it is just the tale of how a dear friend died.\\nTo have read this book is to have known Scott; and if I were asked to\\ndescribe him, I think I should use some such words as those which, six\\nmonths before he died, he used of the gallant gentleman who went with\\nhim, \'Bill\' Wilson. \'Words must always fail when I talk of him,\' he\\nwrote; \'I believe he is the finest character I ever met--the closer one\\ngets to him the more there is to admire. Every quality is so solid and\\ndependable. Whatever the matter, one knows Bill will be sound, shrewdly\\npractical, intensely loyal, and quite unselfish.\' That is true of Wilson,\\nif Scott says so, for he knew men; but most of it is also true of Scott\\nhimself. I have never met a more beautiful character than that which is\\nrevealed unconsciously in these journals. His humanity, his courage, his\\nfaith, his steadfastness, above all, his simplicity, mark him as a man\\namong men. It is because of his simplicity that his last message, the\\nlast entries in his diary, his last letters, are of such undying beauty.\\nThe letter of consolation (and almost of apology) which, on the verge of\\ndeath, he wrote to Mrs. Wilson, wife of the man dying at his side, may\\nwell be Scott\'s monument. He could have no finer. And he has raised a\\nmonument for those other gallant gentlemen who died--Wilson, Oates,\\nBowers, Evans. They are all drawn for us clearly by him in these pages;\\nthey stand out unmistakably. They, too, come to be friends of ours, their\\ndeath is as noble and as heartbreaking. And there were gallant gentlemen,\\nI said, who lived--you may read amazing stories of them. Indeed, it is a\\nwonderful tale of manliness that these two volumes tell us. I put them\\ndown now; but I have been for a few days in the company of the brave ...\\nand every hour with them has made me more proud for those that died and\\nmore humble for myself.\\"\\nI have quoted this review at length, because it gives the atmosphere of\\nhero-worship into which we were plunged on our return. That atmosphere\\nwas very agreeable; but it was a refracting medium through which the\\nexpedition could not be seen with scientific accuracy--and the expedition\\nwas nothing if not scientific. Whilst we knew what we had suffered and\\nrisked better than any one else, we also knew that science takes no\\naccount of such things; that a man is no better for having made the worst\\njourney in the world; and that whether he returns alive or drops by the\\nway will be all the same a hundred years hence if his records and\\nspecimens come safely to hand.\\nIn addition to Scott\'s Last Expedition and Priestley\'s Antarctic\\nAdventures, Griffith Taylor, who was physiographer to the Main Party, has\\nwritten an account of the two geological journeys of which he was the\\nleader, and of the domestic life of the expedition at Hut Point and at\\nCape Evans, up to February 1912, in a book called With Scott: The Silver\\nLining. This book gives a true glimpse into the more boisterous side of\\nour life, with much useful information about the scientific part.\\nThough it bears little upon this book I cannot refrain from drawing the\\nreader\'s attention to, and earning some of his thanks for, a little book\\ncalled Antarctic Penguins, written by Levick, the Surgeon of Campbell\'s\\nParty. It is almost entirely about Ad\xe9lie penguins. The author spent the\\ngreater part of a summer living, as it were, upon sufferance, in the\\nmiddle of one of the largest penguin rookeries in the world. He has\\ndescribed the story of their crowded life with a humour with which,\\nperhaps, we hardly credited him, and with a simplicity which many writers\\nof children\'s stories might envy. If you think your own life hard, and\\nwould like to leave it for a short hour I recommend you to beg, borrow or\\nsteal this tale, and read and see how the penguins live. It is all quite\\ntrue.\\nSo there is already a considerable literature about the expedition, but\\nno connected account of it as a whole. Scott\'s diary, had he lived, would\\nmerely have formed the basis of the book he would have written. As his\\npersonal diary it has an interest which no other book could have had. But\\na diary in this life is one of the only ways in which a man can blow off\\nsteam, and so it is that Scott\'s book accentuates the depression which\\nused to come over him sometimes.\\nWe have seen the importance which must attach to the proper record of\\nimprovements, weights and methods of each and every expedition. We have\\nseen how Scott took the system developed by the Arctic Explorers at the\\npoint of development to which it had been brought by Nansen, and applied\\nit for the first time to Antarctic sledge travelling. Scott\'s Voyage of\\nthe Discovery gives a vivid picture of mistakes rectified, and of\\nimprovements of every kind. Shackleton applied the knowledge they gained\\nin his first expedition, Scott in this, his second and last. On the whole\\nI believe this expedition was the best equipped there has ever been, when\\nthe double purpose, exploratory and scientific, for which it was\\norganized, is taken into consideration. It is comparatively easy to put\\nall your eggs into one basket, to organize your material and to equip and\\nchoose your men entirely for one object, whether it be the attainment of\\nthe Pole, or the running of a perfect series of scientific observations.\\nYour difficulties increase many-fold directly you combine the one with\\nthe other, as was done in this case. Neither Scott nor the men with him\\nwould have gone for the Pole alone. Yet they considered the Pole to be an\\nachievement worthy of a great attempt, and \\"We took risks, we knew we\\ntook them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no\\ncause for complaint....\\"\\nIt is, it must be, of the first importance that a system, I will not say\\nperfected, but developed, to a pitch of high excellence at such a cost\\nshould be handed down as completely as possible to those who are to\\nfollow. I want to so tell this story that the leader of some future\\nAntarctic expedition, perhaps more than one, will be able to take it up\\nand say: \\"I have here the material from which I can order the articles\\nand quantities which will be wanted for so many men for such and such a\\ntime; I have also a record of how this material was used by Scott, of the\\nplans of his journeys and how his plans worked out, and of the\\nimprovements which his parties were able to make on the spot or suggest\\nfor the future. I don\'t agree with such and such, but this is a\\nfoundation and will save me many months of work in preparation, and give\\nme useful knowledge for the actual work of my expedition.\\" If this book\\ncan guide the future explorer by the light of the past, it will not have\\nbeen written in vain.\\nBut this was not my main object in writing this book. When I undertook in\\n1913 to write, for the Antarctic Committee, an Official Narrative on\\ncondition that I was given a free hand, what I wanted to do above all\\nthings was to show what work was done; who did it; to whom the credit of\\nthe work was due; who took the responsibility; who did the hard sledging;\\nand who pulled us through that last and most ghastly year when two\\nparties were adrift, and God only knew what was best to be done; when,\\nhad things gone on much longer, men would undoubtedly have gone mad.\\nThere is no record of these things, though perhaps the world thinks there\\nis. Generally as a mere follower, without much responsibility, and often\\nscared out of my wits, I was in the thick of it all, and I know.\\nUnfortunately I could not reconcile a sincere personal confession with\\nthe decorous obliquity of an Official Narrative; and I found that I had\\nput the Antarctic Committee in a difficulty from which I could rescue\\nthem only by taking the book off their hands; for it was clear that what\\nI had written was not what is expected from a Committee, even though no\\nmember may disapprove of a word of it. A proper Official Narrative\\npresented itself to our imaginations and sense of propriety as a quarto\\nvolume, uniform with the scientific reports, dustily invisible on Museum\\nshelves, and replete with--in the words of my Commission--\\"times of\\nstarting, hours of march, ground and weather conditions,\\" not very useful\\nas material for future Antarcticists, and in no wise effecting any\\ncatharsis of the writer\'s conscience. I could not pretend that I had\\nfulfilled these conditions; and so I decided to take the undivided\\nresponsibility on my own shoulders. None the less the Committee, having\\ngiven me access to its information, is entitled to all the credit of a\\nformal Official Narrative, without the least responsibility for the\\npassages which I have studied to make as personal in style as possible,\\nso that no greater authority may be attached to them than I deserve.\\nI need hardly add that the nine years\' delay in the appearance of my book\\nwas caused by the war. Before I had recovered from the heavy overdraft\\nmade on my strength by the expedition I found myself in Flanders looking\\nafter a fleet of armoured cars. A war is like the Antarctic in one\\nrespect. There is no getting out of it with honour as long as you can put\\none foot before the other. I came back badly invalided; and the book had\\nto wait accordingly.\\n[Illustration: FROM NEW ZEALAND TO THE SOUTH POLE--Apsley Cherry-Garrard,\\ndel.--Emery Walker Ltd., Collotypers.]\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n     [1] Cook, _A Voyage towards the South Pole_, Introduction.\\n     [2] Cook, _A Voyage towards the South Pole_, vol. i. p. 23.\\n     [3] Ibid. p. 28.\\n     [4] Cook, _A Voyage towards the South Pole_, vol. i. p. 268.\\n     [5] Ibid. p. 275.\\n     [6] Scott, _Voyage of the Discovery_, vol. i. p. 9.\\n     [7] Ibid. p. 14.\\n     [8] Ross, _Voyage to the Southern Seas_, vol. i. p. 117.\\n     [9] Ross, _Voyage to the Southern Seas_, vol. i. pp. 216-218.\\n    [10] Ross, _Voyage to the Southern Seas_, vol. i. pp. 244-245.\\n    [11] Leonard Huxley, _Life of Sir J.

So no doubt it was with a sigh of relief that\\nhe saw the Terra Nova out from Cardiff into the Atlantic on June 15,\\n1910. Cardiff had given the expedition a most generous and enthusiastic\\nsend-off, and Scott announced that it should be his first port on\\nreturning to England. Just three years more and the Terra Nova, worked\\nback from New Zealand by Pennell, reached Cardiff again on June 14, 1913,\\nand paid off there.\\nFrom the first everything was informal and most pleasant, and those who\\nhad the good fortune to help in working the ship out to New Zealand,\\nunder steam or sail, must, in spite of five months of considerable\\ndiscomfort and very hard work, look back upon the voyage as one of the\\nvery happiest times of the expedition. To some of us perhaps the voyage\\nout, the three weeks in the pack ice going South, and the Robinson Crusoe\\nlife at Hut Point are the pleasantest of many happy memories.\\nScott made a great point that so far as was possible the personnel of the\\nexpedition must go out with the Terra Nova. Possibly he gave\\ninstructions that they were to be worked hard, and no doubt it was a good\\nopportunity of testing our mettle. We had been chosen out of 8000\\nvolunteers, executive officers, scientific staff, crew, and all.\\nWe differed entirely from the crew of an ordinary merchant ship both in\\nour personnel and in our methods of working. The executive officers were\\ndrawn from the Navy, as were also the crew. In addition there was the\\nscientific staff, including one doctor who was not a naval surgeon, but\\nwho was also a scientist, and two others called by Scott \'adaptable\\nhelpers,\' namely Oates and myself. The scientific staff of the expedition\\nnumbered twelve members all told, but only six were on board: the\\nremainder were to join the ship at Lyttelton, New Zealand, when we made\\nour final embarcation for the South. Of those on the ship Wilson was\\nchief of the scientific staff, and united in himself the various\\nfunctions of vertebral zoologist, doctor, artist, and, as this book will\\nsoon show, the unfailing friend-in-need of all on board. Lieutenant Evans\\nwas in command, with Campbell as first officer. Watches were of course\\nassigned immediately to the executive officers. The crew was divided into\\na port and starboard watch, and the ordinary routine of a sailing ship\\nwith auxiliary steam was followed. Beyond this no work was definitely\\nassigned to any individual on board. How the custom of the ship arose I\\ndo not know, but in effect most things were done by volunteer labour. It\\nwas recognized that every one whose work allowed turned to immediately on\\nany job which was wanted, but it was an absolutely voluntary\\nduty--Volunteers to shorten sail? To coal? To shift cargo? To pump? To\\npaint or wash down paintwork? They were constant calls--some of them\\nalmost hourly calls, day and night--and there was never any failure to\\nrespond fully. This applied not only to the scientific staff but also,\\nwhenever their regular duties allowed, to the executive officers. There\\nwasn\'t an officer on the ship who did not shift coal till he was sick of\\nthe sight of it, but I heard no complaints. Such a system soon singles\\nout the real willing workers, but it is apt to put an undue strain upon\\nthem. Meanwhile most of the executive officers as well as the scientific\\nstaff had their own work to do, which they were left to fit in as most\\nconvenient.\\nThe first days out from England were spent in such hard and crowded work\\nthat we shook down very quickly. I then noticed for the first time\\nWilson\'s great gift of tact, and how quick he was to see the small things\\nwhich make so much difference. At the same time his passion for work set\\na high standard. Pennell was another glutton.\\nWe dropped anchor in Funchal Harbour, Madeira, about 4 P.M. on June 23,\\neight days out. The ship had already been running under sail and steam,\\nthe decks were as clear as possible, there was some paintwork to show,\\nand with a good harbour stow she looked thoroughly workmanlike and neat.\\nSome scientific work, in particular tow netting and magnetic\\nobservations, had already been done. But even as early as this we had\\nspent hours on the pumps, and it was evident that these pumps were going\\nto be a constant nightmare.\\nIn Madeira, as everywhere, we were given freely of such things as we\\nrequired. We left in the early morning of June 26, after Pennell had done\\nsome hours\' magnetic work with the Lloyd Creak and Barrow Dip Circle.\\nOn June 29 (noon position lat. 27\xb0 10\xb4 N., long. 20\xb0 21\xb4 W.) it was\\npossible to write: \\"A fortnight out to-day, and from the general\\nappearance of the wardroom we might have been out a year.\\"\\nWe were to a great extent strangers to one another when we left England,\\nbut officers and crew settled down to their jobs quickly, and when men\\nlive as close as we did they settle down or quarrel before very long. Let\\nus walk into the cabins which surround the small wardroom aft. The first\\non the left is that of Scott and Lieutenant Evans, but Scott is not on\\nboard, and Wilson has taken his place. In the next cabin to them is\\nDrake, the secretary. On the starboard side of the screw are Oates,\\nAtkinson and Levick, the two latter being doctors, and on the port side\\nCampbell and Pennell, who is navigator. Then Rennick and Bowers, the\\nlatter just home from the Persian Gulf--both of these are watchkeepers.\\nIn the next cabin are Simpson, meteorologist, back from Simla, with\\nNelson and Lillie, marine biologists. In the last cabin, the Nursery, are\\nthe youngest, and necessarily the best behaved, of this community,\\nWright, the physicist and chemist, Gran the Norwegian ski-expert, and\\nmyself, Wilson\'s helper and assistant zoologist. It is difficult to put a\\nman down as performing any special job where each did so many, but that\\nis roughly what we were.\\nCertain men already began to stand out. Wilson, with an apparently\\ninexhaustible stock of knowledge on little things and big; always ready\\nto give help, and always ready with sympathy and insight, a tremendous\\nworker, and as unselfish as possible; a universal adviser. Pennell, as\\nhappy as the day was long, working out sights, taking his watch on the\\nbridge, or if not on watch full of energy aloft, trimming coal, or any\\nother job that came along; withal spending hours a day on magnetic work,\\nwhich he did as a hobby, and not in any way as his job. Bowers was\\nproving himself the best seaman on board, with an exact knowledge of the\\nwhereabouts and contents of every case, box and bale, and with a supreme\\ncontempt for heat or cold. Simpson was obviously a first-class scientist,\\ndevoted to his work, in which Wright gave him very great and unselfish\\nhelp, while at the same time doing much of the ship\'s work. Oates and\\nAtkinson generally worked together in a solid, dependable and somewhat\\nhumorous way.\\nEvans, who will always be called Lieutenant Evans in this book to\\ndistinguish him from Seaman Evans, was in charge of the ship, and did\\nmuch to cement together the rough material into a nucleus which was\\ncapable of standing without any friction the strains of nearly three\\nyears of crowded, isolated and difficult life, ably seconded by Victor\\nCampbell, first officer, commonly called The Mate, in whose hands the\\nroutine and discipline of the ship was most efficiently maintained. I was\\nvery frightened of Campbell.\\nScott himself was unable to travel all the way out to New Zealand in the\\nTerra Nova owing to the business affairs of the expedition, but he\\njoined the ship from Simon\'s Bay to Melbourne.\\nThe voyage itself on the sailing track from Madeira to the Cape was at\\nfirst uneventful. We soon got into hot weather, and at night every\\navailable bit of deck space was used on which to sleep. The more\\nparticular slung hammocks, but generally men used such deck space as they\\ncould find, such as the top of the icehouse, where they were free from\\nthe running tackle, and rolled themselves into their blankets. So long as\\nwe had a wind we ran under sail alone, and on those days men would bathe\\nover the side in the morning, but when the engines were going we could\\nget the hose in the morning, which was preferred, especially after a\\nshark was seen making for Bowers\' red breast as he swam.","image":"C01.01.jpeg"},{"merge":"C01.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The crew of the Terra Nova were constantly working hard, whether it was pumping out water, conducting magnetic and meteorological observations, or studying life at sea.

All hands\\nwere roused before six and turned on to the pumps, for the ship was\\nleaking considerably. Normally, the well showed about ten inches of water\\nwhen the ship was dry. Before pumping, the sinker would show anything\\nover two feet. The ship was generally dry after an hour to an hour and a\\nhalf\'s pumping, and by that time we had had quite enough of it. As soon\\nas the officer of the watch had given the order, \\"Vast pumping,\\" the\\nfirst thing to do was to strip, and the deck was dotted with men trying\\nto get the maximum amount of water from the sea in a small bucket let\\ndown on a line from the moving ship. First efforts in this direction\\nwould have been amusing had it not been for the caustic eye of the \'Mate\'\\non the bridge. If the reader ever gets the chance to try the experiment,\\nespecially in a swell, he will soon find himself with neither bucket nor\\nwater. The poor Mate was annoyed by the loss of his buckets.\\nEverybody was working very hard during these days; shifting coal, reefing\\nand furling sail aloft, hauling on the ropes on deck, together with\\nmagnetic and meteorological observations, tow-netting, collecting and\\nmaking skins and so forth. During the first weeks there was more cargo\\nstowing and paintwork than at other times, otherwise the work ran in\\nvery much the same lines all the way out--a period of nearly five months.\\nOn July 1 we were overhauled by the only ship we ever saw, so far as I\\ncan remember, during all that time, the Inverclyde, a barque out from\\nGlasgow to Buenos Ayres. It was an oily, calm day with a sea like glass,\\nand she looked, as Wilson quoted, \\"like a painted ship upon a painted\\nocean,\\" as she lay with all sail set.\\nWe picked up the N.E. Trade two days later, being then north of the Cape\\nVerde Islands (lat. 22\xb0 28\xb4 N., long. 23\xb0 5\xb4 W. at noon). It was a\\nSunday, and there was a general \'make and mend\' throughout the ship, the\\nfirst since we sailed. During the day we ran from deep clear blue water\\ninto a darkish and thick green sea. This remarkable change of colour,\\nwhich was observed by the Discovery Expedition in much the same place,\\nwas supposed to be due to a large mass of pelagic fauna called plankton.\\nThe plankton, which drifts upon the surface of the sea, is distinct from\\nthe nekton, which swims submerged. The Terra Nova was fitted with tow\\nnets with very fine meshes for collecting these inhabitants of the open\\nsea, together with the algae, or minute plant organisms, which afford\\nthem an abundant food supply.\\nThe plankton nets can be lowered when the ship is running at full speed,\\nand a great many such hauls were made during the expedition.\\nJuly 5 had an unpleasant surprise in store. At 10.30 A.M. the ship\'s bell\\nrang and there was a sudden cry of \\"Fire quarters.\\" Two Minimax fire\\nextinguishers finished the fire, which was in the lazarette, and was\\ncaused by a lighted lamp which was upset by the roll of the ship. The\\nresult was a good deal of smoke, a certain amount of water below, and\\nsome singed paper, but we realized that a fire on such an old wooden ship\\nwould be a very serious matter, and greater care was taken after this.\\nSuch a voyage shows Nature in her most attractive form, and always there\\nwas a man close by whose special knowledge was in the whales, porpoises,\\ndolphins, fish, birds, parasites, plankton, radium and other things which\\nwe watched through microscopes or field-glasses. Nelson caught a\\nPortuguese man-of-war (Arethusa) as it sailed past us close under the\\ncounter. These animals are common, but few can realize how beautiful they\\nare until they see them, fresh-coloured from the deep sea, floating and\\nsailing in a big glass bowl. It vainly tried to sail out, and vigorously\\ntried to sting all who touched it. Wilson painted it.\\nFrom first to last the study of life of all kinds was of absorbing\\ninterest to all on board, and, when we landed in the Antarctic, as well\\nas on the ship, everybody worked and was genuinely interested in all that\\nlived and had its being on the fringe of that great sterile continent.\\nNot only did officers who had no direct interest in anything but their\\nown particular work or scientific subject spend a large part of their\\ntime in helping, making notes and keeping observations, but the seamen\\nalso had a large share in the specimens and data of all descriptions\\nwhich have been brought back. Several of them became good pupils for\\nskinning birds.\\nMeanwhile, perhaps the constant cries of \\"Whale, whale!\\" or \\"New bird!\\"\\nor \\"Dolphins!\\" sometimes found the biologist concerned less eager to\\nleave his meal than the observers were to call him forth. Good\\nopportunities of studying the life of sea birds, whales, dolphins and\\nother forms of life in the sea, even those comparatively few forms which\\nare visible from the surface, are not too common. A modern liner moves so\\nquickly that it does not attract life to it in the same way as a\\nslow-moving ship like the Terra Nova, and when specimens are seen they\\nare gone almost as soon as they are observed. Those who wish to study sea\\nlife--and there is much to be done in this field--should travel by tramp\\nsteamers, or, better still, sailing vessels.\\nDolphins were constantly playing under the bows of the ship, giving a\\nvery good chance for identification, and whales were also frequently\\nsighted, and would sometimes follow the ship, as did also hundreds of sea\\nbirds, petrels, shearwaters and albatross. It says much for the interest\\nand keenness of the officers on board that a complete hourly log was\\nkept from beginning to end of the numbers and species which were seen,\\ngenerally with the most complete notes as to any peculiarity or habit\\nwhich was noticed. It is to be hoped that full use will be made, by those\\nin charge of the working out of these results, of these logs which were\\nkept so thoroughly and sometimes under such difficult circumstances and\\nconditions of weather and sea. Though many helped, this log was largely\\nthe work of Pennell, who was an untiring and exact observer.\\nWe lost the N.E. Trade about July 7, and ran into the Doldrums. On the\\nwhole we could not complain of the weather. We never had a gale or big\\nsea until after leaving South Trinidad, and though an old ship with no\\nmodern ventilation is bound to be stuffy in the tropics, we lived and\\nslept on deck so long as it was not raining. If it rained at night, as it\\nfrequently does in this part of the world, a number of rolled-up forms\\ncould be heard discussing as to whether it was best to stick it above or\\nface the heat below; and if the rain persisted, sleepy and somewhat\\nsnappy individuals were to be seen trying to force themselves and a\\nmaximum amount of damp bedding down the wardroom gangway. At the same\\ntime a thick wooden ship will keep fairly cool in the not severe heat\\nthrough which we passed.\\nOne want which was unavoidable was the lack of fresh water. There was\\nnone to wash in, though a glass of water was allowed for shaving! With an\\nunlimited amount of sea water this may not seem much of a hardship; nor\\nis it unless you have very dirty work to do. But inasmuch as some of the\\nofficers were coaling almost daily, they found that any amount of cold\\nsea water, even with a euphemistically named \'sea-water soap,\' had no\\nvery great effect in removing the coal dust. The alternative was to make\\nfriends with the engine-room authorities and draw some water from the\\nboilers.\\nPerhaps therefore it was not with purely disinterested motives that some\\nof us undertook to do the stoking during the morning watch, and also\\nlater in the day during our passage through the tropics, since the\\nengine-room staff was reduced by sickness. A very short time will\\nconvince anybody that the ease with which men accustomed to this work get\\nthrough their watch is mainly due to custom and method. The ship had no\\nforced draught nor modern ventilating apparatus. Four hours in the\\nboiling fiery furnace which the Terra Nova\'s stokehold formed in the\\ntropics, unless there was a good wind to blow down the one canvas shaft,\\nwas a real test of staying power, and the actual shovelling of the coal\\ninto the furnaces, one after the other, was as child\'s play to handling\\nthe \'devil,\' as the weighty instrument used for breaking up the clinker\\nand shaping the fire was called. The boilers were cylindrical marine or\\nreturn tube boilers, the furnaces being six feet long by three feet wide,\\nslightly lower at the back than at the front. The fire on the bars was\\nkept wedge-shape, that is, some nine inches high at the back, tapering to\\nabout six inches in front against the furnace doors. The furnaces were\\ncorrugated for strength. We were supposed to keep the pressure on the\\ngauge between 70 and 80, but it wanted some doing. For the most part it\\nwas done.","image":"C01.02.jpeg"},{"merge":"C01.03","output":"The passage describes the discomfort of rain and high temperatures on the ship, as well as the crossing of the Line and the expedition\'s landing on South Trinidad.

But it had its\\nadvantages in the fresh water it produced. Every bucket was on duty, and\\nthe ship\'s company stripped naked and ran about the decks or sat in the\\nstream between the laboratories and wardroom skylight and washed their\\nvery dirty clothes. The stream came through into our bunks, and no amount\\nof caulking ever stopped it. To sleep with a constant drip of water\\nfalling upon you is a real trial. These hot, wet days were more trying to\\nthe nerves than the months of wet, rough but cooler weather to come, and\\nit says much for the good spirit which prevailed that there was no\\nfriction, though we were crowded together like sardines in a tin.\\nJuly 12 was a typical day (lat. 4\xb0 57\xb4 N., long. 22\xb0 4\xb4 W.). A very hot,\\nrainy night, followed by a squall which struck us while we were having\\nbreakfast, so we went up and set all sail, which took until about 9.30\\nA.M. We then sat in the water on the deck and washed clothes until just\\nbefore mid-day, when the wind dropped, though the rain continued. So we\\nwent up and furled all sail, a tedious business when the sails are wet\\nand heavy. Then work on cargo or coal till 7 P.M., supper, and glad to\\nget to sleep.\\nOn July 15 (lat. 0\xb0 40\xb4 N., long. 21\xb0 56\xb4 W.) we crossed the Line with\\nall pomp and ceremony. At 1.15 P.M. Neptune in the person of Seaman Evans\\nhailed and stopped the ship. He came on board with his motley company,\\nwho solemnly paced aft to the break of the poop, where he was met by\\nLieutenant Evans. His wife (Browning), a doctor (Paton), barber\\n(Cheetham), two policemen and four bears, of whom Atkinson and Oates were\\ntwo, grouped themselves round him while the barrister (Abbott) read an\\naddress to the captain, and then the procession moved round to the bath,\\na sail full of water slung in the break of the poop on the starboard\\nside.\\nNelson was the first victim. He was examined, then overhauled by the\\ndoctor, given a pill and a dose, and handed over to the barber, who\\nlathered him with a black mixture consisting of soot, flour and water,\\nwas shaved by Cheetham with a great wooden razor, and then the policemen\\ntipped him backwards into the bath where the bears were waiting. As he\\nwas being pushed in he seized the barber and took him with him.\\nWright, Lillie, Simpson and Levick followed, with about six of the crew.\\nFinally Gran, the Norwegian, was caught as an extra--never having been\\nacross the Line in a British ship. But he threw the pill-distributing\\ndoctor over his head into the bath, after which he was lathered very\\ngingerly, and Cheetham having been in once, refused to shave him at all,\\nso they tipped him in and wished they had never caught him.\\nThe procession re-formed, and Neptune presented certificates to those who\\nhad been initiated. The proceedings closed with a sing-song in the\\nevening.\\nThese sing-songs were of very frequent occurrence. The expedition was\\nvery fond of singing, though there was hardly anybody in it who could\\nsing. The usual custom at this time was that every one had to contribute\\na song in turn all round the table after supper. If he could not sing he\\nhad to compose a limerick. If he could not compose a limerick he had to\\ncontribute a fine towards the wine fund, which was to make some\\nmuch-discussed purchases when we reached Cape Town. At other times we\\nplayed the most childish games--there was one called \'The Priest of the\\nParish has lost his Cap,\' over which we laughed till we cried, and much\\nmoney was added to the wine fund.\\nAs always happens, certain songs became conspicuous for a time. One of\\nthese I am sure that Campbell, who was always at work and upon whom the\\nroutine of the ship depended, will never forget. I do not know who it was\\nthat started singing\\n    \\"Everybody works but Father,\\n    That poor old man,\\"\\nbut Campbell, who was the only father on board and whose hair was\\npopularly supposed to be getting thin on the top of his head, may\\nremember.\\nWe began to make preparations for a run ashore--a real adventure on an\\nuninhabited and unknown island. The sailing track of ships from England\\nround the Cape of Good Hope lies out towards the coast of Brazil, and not\\nfar from the mysterious island of South Trinidad, 680 miles east of\\nBrazil, in 20\xb0 30\xb4 S. and 29\xb0 30\xb4 W.\\nThis island is difficult of access, owing to its steep rocky coast and\\nthe big Atlantic swell which seldom ceases. It has therefore been little\\nvisited, and as it is infested with land crabs the stay of the few\\nparties which have been there has been short. But scientifically it is of\\ninterest, not only for the number of new species which may be obtained\\nthere, but also for the extraordinary attitude of wild sea birds towards\\nhuman beings whom they have never learnt to fear. Before we left England\\nit had been decided to attempt a landing and spend a day there if we\\nshould pass sufficiently near to it.\\nThose who have visited it in the past include the astronomer Halley, who\\noccupied it, in 1700. Sir James Ross, outward bound for the Antarctic in\\n1839, spent a day there, landing \\"in a small cove a short distance to\\nthe northward of the Nine Pin Rock of Halley, the surf on all other parts\\nbeing too great to admit of it without hazarding the destruction of our\\nboats.\\" Ross also writes that \\"Horsburgh mentions ... \'that the island\\nabounds with wild pig and goats; one of the latter was seen. With the\\nview to add somewhat to the stock of useful creatures, a cock and two\\nhens were put on shore; they seemed to enjoy the change, and, I have no\\ndoubt, in so unfrequented a situation, and so delightful a climate, will\\nquickly increase in numbers.\' I am afraid we did not find any of their\\ndescendants, nor those of the pig and goats.\\"[34] I doubt whether fowls\\nwould survive the land crabs very long. There are many wild birds on the\\nisland, however, which may feed the shipwrecked, and also a dep\xf4t left by\\nthe Government for that purpose. Another visitor was Knight, who wrote a\\nbook called The Cruise of the Falcon, concerning his efforts to discover\\nthe treasure which is said to have been left there. Scott also visited it\\nin the Discovery in 1901, when a new petrel was found which was\\nafterwards called \'Oestrelata wilsoni,\' after the same \'Uncle Bill\' who\\nwas zoologist of both Scott\'s Expeditions.\\nAnd so it came about that on the evening of July 25 we furled sail and\\nlay five miles from South Trinidad with all our preparations made for a\\nvery thorough search of this island of treasure. Everything was to be\\ncaptured, alive or dead, animal, vegetable or mineral.\\nAt half-past five the next morning we were steaming slowly towards what\\nlooked like a quite impregnable face of rock, with bare cliffs standing\\nstraight out of the water, which, luckily for us, was comparatively\\nsmooth. As we coasted to try and find a landing-place the sun was rising\\nbehind the island, which reaches to a height of two thousand feet, and\\nthe jagged cliffs stood up finely against the rosy sky.\\n[Illustration: SOUTH TRINIDAD--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nWe dropped our anchor to the south of the island and a boat\'s crew left\\nto prospect for a landing-place, whilst Wilson seized the opportunity to\\nshoot some birds as specimens, including two species of frigate bird,\\nand the seamen caught some of the multitudinous fish. We also fired shots\\nat the sharks which soon thronged round the ship, and about which we were\\nto think more before the day was done.\\nThe boat came back with the news that a possible landing-place had been\\nfound, and the landing parties got off about 8.30. The landing was very\\nbad--a ledge of rock weathered out of the cliff to our right formed, as\\nit were, a staging along which it was possible to pass on to a steeply\\nshelving talus slope in front of us. The sea being comparatively smooth,\\neverybody was landed dry, with their guns and collecting gear.\\nThe best account of South Trinidad is contained in a letter written by\\nBowers to his mother, which is printed here. But some brief notes which I\\njotted down at the time may also be of interest, since they give an\\naccount of a different part of the island:","image":"C01.03.jpeg"},{"merge":"C01.04","output":"[\\"The explorers climb to the top of a remote, uninhabited island, collecting a variety of bird eggs and specimens and encountering thousands of land crabs and insect life.

This was our first stand, and we shot several white-breasted petrel\\n(Oestrelata trinitatis), and also black-breasted petrel (Oestrelata\\narminjoniana). Later on we got over the brow of a cliff where the petrel\\nwere nesting. We took two nests, on each of which a white-breasted and a\\nblack-breasted petrel were paired. Wilson caught one in his hands and I\\ncaught another on its nest; it really did not know whether it ought to\\nfly away or not. This gives rise to an interesting problem, since these\\ntwo birds have been classified as different species, and it now looks as\\nthough they are the same.\\n\\"The gannets and terns were quite extraordinary, like all the living\\nthings there. If you stay still enough the terns perch on your head. In\\nany case they will not fly off the rocks till you are two or three feet\\naway. Several gannets were caught in the men\'s hands. All the fish which\\nthe biologist collected to-day can travel quite fast on land. When the\\nDiscovery was here Wilson saw a fish come out of the sea, seize a land\\ncrab about eighteen inches away and take it back into the water.\\n\\"The land crabs were all over the place in thousands; it seems probable\\nthat their chief enemies are themselves. They are regular cannibals.\\n\\"Then we did a real long climb northwards, over rocks and tufty grass\\ntill 1.30 P.M. From the point we had reached we could see both sides of\\nthe island, and the little Martin Vas islands in the distance.\\n\\"We found lots of little tern and terns\' eggs, lying out on the bare rock\\nwith no nest at all. Hooper also brought us two little gannets--all\\nfluffy, but even at this age larger than a rook. As we got further up we\\nbegan to come across the fossilized trees for which the island is well\\nknown.\\n\\"Four or five Captain biscuits made an excellent lunch, and afterwards we\\nstarted to the real top of the island, a hill rising to the west of us.\\nIt was covered with a high scrubby bush and rocks, and was quite thick;\\nin fact there was more vegetation here than on all the rest we had seen,\\nand in making our way through it we had to keep calling in order to keep\\ntouch with one another.\\n\\"The tree ferns were numerous, but stunted. The gannets were sleeping on\\nthe tops of the bushes, and some of the crabs had climbed up the bushes\\nand were sunning themselves on the top. These crabs were round us in\\nthousands--I counted seven watching me out of one crack between two\\nrocks.\\n\\"We sat down under the lee of the summit, and thought it would not be bad\\nto be thrown away on a desert island, little thinking how near we were to\\nbeing stranded, for a time at any rate.\\n\\"The crabs gathered round us in a circle, with their eyes turning towards\\nus--as if they were waiting for us to die to come and eat us. One big\\nfellow left his place in the circle and waddled up to my feet and\\nexamined my boots. First with one claw and then with the other he took a\\ntaste of my boot. He went away obviously disgusted: one could almost see\\nhim shake his head.\\n\\"We collected, as well as our birds and eggs, some spiders, very large\\ngrasshoppers, wood-lice, cockchafers, with big and small centipedes. In\\nfact, the place teemed with insect life. I should add that their names\\nare given rather from the general appearance of the animals than from\\ntheir true scientific classes.\\n\\"We had a big and fast scramble down, and about half way, when we could\\nwatch the sea breaking on the rocks far below, we saw that there was a\\nbigger swell running. It was getting late, and we made our way down as\\nfast as we could--denting our guns as we slipped on the rocks.\\n\\"The lower we got the bigger the sea which had risen in our absence\\nappeared to be. No doubt it was the swell of a big disturbance far away,\\nand when we reached the d\xe9bris slope where we had landed, flanked by big\\ncliffs, we found everybody gathered there and the boats lying off--it\\nbeing quite impossible for them to get near the shore.\\n\\"They had just got a life-line ashore on a buoy. Bowers went out on to\\nthe rocks and secured it. We put our guns and specimens into a pile, out\\nof reach, as we thought, of any possible sea. But just afterwards two\\nvery large waves took us--we were hauling in the rope, and must have been\\na good thirty feet above the base of the wave. It hit us hard and knocked\\nus all over the place, and wetted the guns and specimens above us through\\nand through.\\n\\"We then stowed all gear and specimens well out of the reach of the seas,\\nand then went out through the surf one by one, passing ourselves out on\\nthe line. It was ticklish work, but Hooper was the only one who really\\nhad a bad time. He did not get far enough out among the rocks which\\nfringed the steep slope from which he started as a wave began to roll\\nback. The next wave caught him and crashed him back, and he let go of the\\nline. He was under quite a long time, and as the waves washed back all\\nthat we could do was to try and get the line to him. Luckily he succeeded\\nin finding the slack of the line and got out.\\n\\"When we first got down to the shore and things were looking nasty,\\nWilson sat down on the top of a rock and ate a biscuit in the coolest\\npossible manner. It was an example to avoid all panicking, for he did\\nnot want the biscuit.\\n\\"He remarked afterwards to me, apropos to Hooper, that it was a curious\\nthing that a number of men, knowing that there was nothing they could do,\\ncould quietly watch a man fighting for his life, and he did not think\\nthat any but the British temperament could do so. I also found out later\\nthat he and I had both had a touch of cramp while waiting for our turn to\\nswim out through the surf.\\"\\nThe following is Bowers\' letter:\\n    \\"_Sunday, 31st July._\\n    \\"The past week has been so crowded with incident, really, that I\\n    don\'t know where to start. Getting to land made me long for the\\n    mails from you, which are such a feature of getting to port.\\n    However, the strange uninhabited island which we visited will\\n    have to make up for my disappointment till we get to Capetown--or\\n    rather Simon\'s Town. Campbell and I sighted S. Trinidad from the\\n    fore yardarm on 25th, and on 26th, at first thing in the morning,\\n    we crept up to an anchorage in a sea of glass. The S.E. Trades,\\n    making a considerable sea, were beating on the eastern sides,\\n    while the western was like a mill-pond. The great rocks and hills\\n    to over 2000 feet towered above us as we went in very close in\\n    order to get our anchor down, as the water is very deep to quite\\n    a short distance from the shore. West Bay was our selection, and\\n    so clear was the water that we could see the anchor at the bottom\\n    in 15 fathoms. A number of sharks and other fish appeared at once\\n    and several birds. Evans wanted to explore, so Oates, Rennick,\\n    Atkinson and myself went away with him--pulling the boat. We\\n    examined the various landings and found them all rocky and\\n    dangerous. There was a slight surf although the sea looked like a\\n    mill-pond. We finally decided on a previously unused place, which\\n    was a little inlet among the rocks.\\n    \\"There was nothing but rock, but there was a little nook where we\\n    decided to try and land. We returned to breakfast and found that\\n    Wilson and Cherry-Garrard had shot several Frigate and other\\n    birds from the ship, the little Norwegian boat--called a\\n    Pram--being used to pick them up.

Wilson and Garrard with their\\n    guns for birds: Oates with the dogs, and Atkinson with a small\\n    rifle: Lillie after plants and geological specimens: Nelson and\\n    Simpson along the shore after sea beasts, etc.: and last but not\\n    least came the entomological party, under yours truly, with\\n    Wright and, later, Evans, as assistants. Pennell joined up with\\n    Wilson, so altogether we were ready to \'do\' the island. I have\\n    taken over the collection of insects for the expedition, as the\\n    other scientists all have so much to do that they were only too\\n    glad to shove the small beasts on me. Atkinson is a specialist in\\n    parasites: it is called \'Helminthology.\' I never heard that name\\n    before. He turns out the interior of every beast that is killed,\\n    and being also a surgeon, I suppose the subject must be\\n    interesting. White terns abounded on the island. They were\\n    ghost-like and so tame that they would sit on one\'s hat. They\\n    laid their eggs on pinnacles of rock without a vestige of nest,\\n    and singly. They looked just like stones. I suppose this was a\\n    protection from the land-crabs, about which you will have heard.\\n    The land-crabs of Trinidad are a byword and they certainly\\n    deserve the name, as they abound from sea-level to the top of the\\n    island. The higher up the bigger they were. The surface of the\\n    hills and valleys was covered with loose boulders, and the whole\\n    island being of volcanic origin, coarse grass is everywhere, and\\n    at about 1500 feet is an area of tree ferns and subtropical\\n    vegetation, extending up to nearly the highest parts. The\\n    withered trees of a former forest are everywhere and their\\n    existence unexplained, though Lillie had many ingenious theories.\\n    The island has been in our hands, the Germans\', and is now\\n    Brazilian. Nobody has been able to settle there permanently,\\n    owing to the land-crabs. These also exclude mammal life. Captain\\n    Kidd made a treasure dep\xf4t there, and some five years ago a chap\\n    named Knight lived on the island for six months with a party of\\n    Newcastle miners--trying to get at it. He had the place all\\n    right, but a huge landslide has covered up three-quarters of a\\n    million of the pirate\'s gold. The land-crabs are little short of\\n    a nightmare. They peep out at you from every nook and boulder.\\n    Their dead staring eyes follow your every step as if to say, \'If\\n    only you will drop down we will do the rest.\' To lie down and\\n    sleep on any part of the island would be suicidal. Of course,\\n    Knight had a specially cleared place with all sorts of\\n    precautions, otherwise he would never have survived these beasts,\\n    which even tried to nibble your boots as you stood--staring hard\\n    at you the whole time. One feature that would soon send a lonely\\n    man off his chump is that no matter how many are in sight they\\n    are all looking at you, and they follow step by step with a\\n    sickly deliberation. They are all yellow and pink, and next to\\n    spiders seem the most loathsome creatures on God\'s earth. Talking\\n    about spiders [Bowers always had the greatest horror of\\n    spiders]--I have to collect them as well as insects. Needless to\\n    say I caught them with a butterfly net, and never touched one.\\n    Only five species were known before, and I found fifteen or\\n    more--at any rate I have fifteen for certain. Others helped me to\\n    catch them, of course. Another interesting item to science is the\\n    fact that I caught a moth hitherto unknown to exist on the\\n    island, also various flies, ants, etc. Altogether it was a most\\n    successful day. Wilson got dozens of birds, and Lillie plants,\\n    etc. On our return to the landing-place we found to our horror\\n    that a southerly swell was rolling in, and great breakers were\\n    bursting on the beach. About five P.M. we all collected and\\n    looked at the whaler and pram on one side of the rollers and\\n    ourselves on the other. First it was impossible to take off the\\n    guns and specimens, so we made them all up to leave for the\\n    morrow. Second, a sick man had come ashore for exercise, and he\\n    could not be got off: finally, Atkinson stayed ashore with him.\\n    The breakers made the most awe-inspiring cauldron in our little\\n    nook, and it meant a tough swim for all of us. Three of us swam\\n    out first and took a line to the pram, and finally we got a good\\n    rope from the whaler, which had anchored well out, to the shore.\\n    I then manoeuvred the pram, and everybody plunged into the surf\\n    and hauled himself out with the rope. All well, but minus our\\n    belongings, and got back to the ship; very wet and ravenous was a\\n    mild way to put it. During my 12 to 4 watch that night the surf\\n    roared like thunder, and the ship herself was rolling like\\n    anything, and looked horribly close to the shore. Of course she\\n    was quite safe really. It transpired that Atkinson and the seaman\\n    had a horrible night with salt water soaked food, and the crabs\\n    and white terns which sat and watched them all night, squawking\\n    in chorus whenever they moved. It must have been horrible, though\\n    I would like to have stayed, and had I known anybody was staying\\n    would have volunteered. This with the noise of the surf and the\\n    cold made it pretty rotten for them. In the morning, Evans,\\n    Rennick, Oates and I, with two seamen and Gran, took the whaler\\n    and pram in to rescue the maroons. At first we thought we would\\n    do it by a rocket line to the end of the sheer cliff. The\\n    impossibility of such an idea was at once evident, so Gran and I\\n    went in close in the pram, and hove them lines to get off the\\n    gear first. I found the spoon-shaped pram a wonderful boat to\\n    handle. You could go in to the very edge of the breaking surf,\\n    lifted like a cork on top of the waves, and as long as you kept\\n    head to sea and kept your own head, you need never have got on\\n    the rocks, as the tremendous back-swish took you out like a shot\\n    every time. It was quite exciting, however, as we would slip in\\n    close in a lull, and the chaps in the whaler would yell, \'Look\\n    out!\' if a big wave passed them, in which case you would pull out\\n    for dear life. Our first lines carried away, and then, with\\n    others, Rennick and I this time took the pram while Atkinson got\\n    as near the edge as safe to throw us the gear. I was pulling, and\\n    by watching our chances we rescued the cameras and glasses, once\\n    being carried over 12 feet above the rocks and only escaping by\\n    the back-swish. Then the luckiest incident of the day occurred,\\n    when in a lull we got our sick man down, and I jumped out, and he\\n    in, as I steadied the boat\'s stern. The next minute the boat\\n    flew out on the back-wash with the seaman absolutely dry, and I\\n    was of course enveloped in foam and blackness two seconds later\\n    by a following wave. Twice the day before this had happened, but\\n    this time for a moment I thought, \'Where will my head strike?\' as\\n    I was like a feather in a breeze in that swirl. When I banked it\\n    was about 15 feet above, and, very scratched and winded, I clung\\n    on with my nails and scrambled up higher. The next wave, a bigger\\n    one, nearly had me, but I was just too high to be sucked back.\\n    Atkinson and I then started getting the gear down, Evans having\\n    taken my place in the pram. By running down between waves we hove\\n    some items into the boat, including the guns and rifles, which I\\n    went right down to throw. These were caught and put into the\\n    boat, but Evans was too keen to save a bunch of boots that\\n    Atkinson threw down, and the next minute the pram passed over my\\n    head and landed high and dry, like a bridge, over the rocks\\n    between which I was wedged. I then scrambled out as the next wave\\n    washed her still higher, right over and over, with Evans and\\n    Rennick just out in time. The next wave--a huge one--picked her\\n    up, and out she bumped over the rocks and out to sea she went,\\n    water-logged, with the guns, fortunately, jammed under the\\n    thwarts. She was rescued by the whaler, baled out, and then Gran\\n    and one of the seamen manned her battered remains again, and we,\\n    unable to save the gear otherwise, lashed it to life-buoys, threw\\n    it into the sea and let it drift out with the back-wash to be\\n    picked up by the pram.\\n    \\"Clothes, watches and ancient guns, rifles, ammunition, birds\\n    (dead) and all specimens were, with the basket of crockery and\\n    food, soaked with salt water. However, the choice was between\\n    that or leaving them altogether, as anybody would have said had\\n    they seen the huge rollers breaking among the rocks and washing\\n    30 to 40 feet up with the spray; in fact, we were often knocked\\n    over and submerged for a time, clinging hard to some rock or one\\n    of the ropes for dear life. Evans swam off first. Then I was\\n    about half an hour trying to rescue a hawser and some lines\\n    entangled among the rocks. It was an amusing job. I would wait\\n    for a lull, run down and haul away, staying under for smaller\\n    waves and running up the rocks like a hare when the warning came\\n    from the boat that a series of big ones were coming in. I finally\\n    rescued most of it--had to cut off some and got it to the place\\n    opposite the boat, and with Rennick secured it and sent it out to\\n    sea to be picked up. My pair of brown tennis shoes (old ones) had\\n    been washed off my feet in one of the scrambles, so I was wearing\\n    a pair of sea-boots--Nelson\'s, I found--which, fortunately for\\n    him, was one of the few pairs saved. The pram came in, and\\n    waiting for a back-wash Rennick swam off. I ran down after the\\n    following wave, and securing my green hat, which by the bye is a\\n    most useful asset, struck out through the boiling, and grabbed\\n    the pram safely as we were lifted on the crest of an immense\\n    roller. However, we were just beyond its breaking-point, so all\\n    was well, and we arrived aboard after eight hours\' wash and\\n    wetness, and none the worse, except for a few scratches, and\\n    yours truly in high spirits. We stayed there that night, and the\\n    following, Thursday, morning left. Winds are not too favourable\\n    so far, as we dropped the S.E. Trades almost immediately, and\\n    these are the variables between the Trades and the Westerlies.\\n    Still 2500 miles off our destination. Evans has therefore decided\\n    to steer straight for Simon\'s Town and miss out the other\\n    islands. It is a pity, but as it is winter down here, and the\\n    worst month of the year for storms at Tristan Da Cunha, it is\\n    perhaps just as well. I am longing to get to the Cape to have\\n    your letters and hear all about you. Except for the absence of\\n    news, life aboard is much to be desired. I simply love it, and\\n    enjoy every day of my existence here. Time flies like anything,\\n    and though it must have been long to you, to us it goes like the\\n    wind--so different to that fortnight on the passage home from\\n    India.\\"[35]\\nAfter the return of the boat\'s crew we left South Trinidad, and the\\nzoologists had a busy time trying to save as many as possible of the bird\\nskins which had been procured. They skinned on all through the following\\nnight, and, considering that the birds had been lying out in the tropics\\nfor twenty-four hours soaked with sea-water and had been finally capsized\\nin the overturned boat, the result was not so disappointing as was\\nexpected. But the eggs and many other articles were lost. Since the\\nblack-breasted and white-breasted petrels were seen flying and nesting\\npaired together, it is reasonable to suppose that their former\\nclassification as two separate species will have to be revised.\\nSoon after leaving South Trinidad we picked up our first big long swell,\\nlogged at 8, and began to learn that the Terra Nova can roll as few ships\\ncan. This was followed by a stiff gale on our port beam, and we took over\\nour first green seas. Bowers wrote home as follows:\\n    _August 7th, Sunday._\\n\\"All chances of going to Tristan are over, and we are at last booming\\nalong with strong Westerlies with the enormous Southern rollers lifting\\nus like a cork on their crests. We have had a stiff gale and a very high\\nsea, which is now over, though it is still blowing a moderate gale, and\\nthe usual crowd of Albatross, Mollymawks, Cape Hens, Cape Pigeons, etc.,\\nare following us. These will be our companions down to the South.\\nWilson\'s idea is that, as the prevailing winds round the forties are\\nWesterlies, these birds simply fly round and round the world--via Cape\\nHorn, New Zealand and the Cape of Good Hope. We have had a really good\\nopportunity now of testing the ship\'s behaviour, having been becalmed\\nwith a huge beam swell rolling 35\xb0 each way, and having stood out a heavy\\ngale with a high sea. In both she has turned up trumps, and really I\\nthink a better little sea boat never floated. Compared to the Loch\\nTorridon--which was always awash in bad weather--we are as dry as a cork,\\nand never once shipped a really heavy sea. Of course a wooden ship has\\nsome buoyancy of herself, and we are no exception. We are certainly an\\nexception for general seaworthiness--if not for speed--and a safer,\\nsounder ship there could not be. The weather is now cool too--cold, some\\npeople call it. I am still comfortable in cotton shirts and whites, while\\nsome are wearing Shetland gear. Nearly everybody is provided with\\nShetland things. I am glad you have marked mine, as they are all so much\\nalike. I am certainly as well provided with private gear as anybody, and\\nfar better than most, so, being as well a generator of heat in myself, I\\nshould be O.K. in any temperature. By the bye Evans and Wilson are very\\nkeen on my being in the Western Party, while Campbell wants me with him\\nin the Eastern Party. I have not asked to go ashore, but am keen on\\nanything and am ready to do anything. In fact there is so much going on\\nthat I feel I should like to be in all three places at once--East, West\\nand Ship.\\"\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n    [34] Ross, _Voyage to the Southern Seas_, vol. i. pp. 22-24.\\n    [35] Bowers\' letter.\\n\\n\\n","image":"C01.05.jpeg"},{"merge":"C02.01","output":"{\\n    \\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the morning routine of an officer from the early morning to the early dawn on a ship during a voyage to the south pole.\\",\\n    \\"excerpt_1\\": \\"If, as is possible, he sleeps in the Nursery, his task may not be so simple as it may seem, for this cabin, which proclaims on one of the beams that it is designed to accommodate four seamen, will house six scientists or pseudo-scientists, in addition to a pianola.\\",\\n    \\"excerpt_2\\": \\"\\\\\\"Clew up\\\\\\" is the next order, and then \\\\\\"All hands furl fore and main upper topsails,\\\\\\" and up we go out on to the yard.\\",\\n    \\"text_to_image\\": \\"An oilskinned seaman walks out of a cabin with the officer of the watch inside.

Since these\\nscientists are the youngest in the expedition their cabin is named the\\nNursery.\\nIncidentally it forms also the gangway from the wardroom to the\\nengine-room, from which it is divided only by a wooden door, which has a\\nbad habit of swinging open and shutting with the roll of the ship and the\\nweight of the oilskins hung upon it, and as it does so, wave upon wave,\\nthe clatter of the engines advances and recedes.\\nIf, however, it is the officer of the watch he will be in a smaller\\ncabin farther aft which he shares with one other man only, and his\\ntroubles are simplified.\\nOwing to the fact that the seams in the deck above have travelled many\\nvoyages, and have been strained in addition by the boat davits and\\ndeck-houses built on the poop, a good deal of water from this part of the\\ndeck, which is always awash in bad weather, finds its way below, that is\\ninto the upper bunks of our cabins. In order that only a minimum of this\\nmay find its way into our blankets a series of shoots, invented and\\ncarefully tended by the occupants of these bunks, are arranged to catch\\nthis water as it falls and carry it over our heads on to the deck of the\\ncabin.\\nThus it is that when this sleepy officer or scientist clambers down on to\\nthe deck he will, if he is lucky, find the water there, instead of\\nleaving it in his bunk. He searches round for his sea-boots, gets into\\nhis oilskins, curses if the strings of his sou\'wester break as he tries\\nto tie them extra firmly round his neck, and pushes along to the open\\ndoor into the wardroom. It is still quite dark, for the sun does not rise\\nfor another hour and a half, but the diminished light from the swinging\\noil-lamp which hangs there shows him a desolate early morning scene which\\nhe comes to hate--especially if he is inclined to be sick.\\nAs likely as not more than one sea has partially found its way down\\nduring the night, and a small stream runs over the floor each time the\\nship rolls. The white oilcloth has slipped off the table, and various\\noddments, dirty cocoa cups, ash-trays, and other litter from the night\\nare rolling about too. The tin cups and plates and crockery in the pantry\\nforrard of the wardroom come together with a sickening crash.\\nThe screw keeps up a ceaseless chonk-chonk-chonk (pause),\\nchonk-chonk-chonk (pause), chonk-chonk-chonk.\\nWatching his opportunity he slides down across the wet linoleum to the\\nstarboard side, whence the gangway runs up to the chart-house and so out\\non to the deck. Having glanced at the barograph slung up in the\\nchart-room, and using all his strength to force the door out enough to\\nsqueeze through, he scrambles out into blackness.\\nThe wind is howling through the rigging, the decks are awash. It is hard\\nto say whether it is raining, for the spray cut off by the wind makes\\nrain a somewhat insignificant event. As he makes his way up on to the\\nbridge, not a very lofty climb, he looks to see what sail is set, and\\njudges so far as he can the force of the wind.\\nCampbell, for he is the officer of the morning watch (4 A.M.-8 A.M.) has\\na talk with the officer he is relieving, Bowers. He is given the course,\\nthe last hour\'s reading on the Cherub patent log trailing out over the\\nstern, and the experiences of the middle watch of the wind, whether\\nrising or falling or squalling, and its effect on the sails and the ship.\\n\\"If you keep her on her present course, she\'s all right, but if you try\\nand bring her up any more she begins to shake. And, by the way, Penelope\\nwants to be called at 4.30.\\" Bowers\' \'snotty,\' who is Oates, probably\\nmakes some ribald remarks, such as no midshipman should to a full\\nlieutenant, and they both disappear below. Campbell\'s snotty, myself,\\nappears about five minutes afterwards trying to look as though some\\nimportant duty and not bed had kept him from making an earlier\\nappearance. Meanwhile the leading hand musters the watch on deck and\\nreports them all present.\\n\\"How about that cocoa?\\" says Campbell. Cocoa is a useful thing in the\\nmorning watch, and Gran, who used to be Campbell\'s snotty, and whose\\nEnglish was not then perfect, said he was glad of a change because he\\n\\"did not like being turned into a drumstick\\" (he meant a domestic).\\nSo cocoa is the word and the snotty starts on an adventurous voyage over\\nthe deck to the galley which is forrard; if he is unlucky he gets a sea\\nover him on the way. Here he finds the hands of the watch, smoking and\\nkeeping warm, and he forages round for some hot water, which he gets\\nsafely back to the pantry down in the wardroom. Here he mixes the cocoa\\nand collects sufficient clean mugs (if he can find them), spoons, sugar\\nand biscuits to go round. These he carefully \\"chocks off\\" while he goes\\nand calls Wilson and gives him his share--for Wilson gets up at 4.30\\nevery morning to sketch the sunrise, work at his scientific paintings\\nand watch the sea-birds flying round the ship. Then back to the bridge,\\nand woe betide him if he falls on the way, for then it all has to be done\\nover again.\\nPennell, who sleeps under the chart table on the bridge, is also fed and\\ninquires anxiously whether there are any stars showing. If there are he\\nis up immediately to get an observation, and then retires below to work\\nit out and to tabulate the endless masses of figures which go to make up\\nthe results of his magnetic observations--dip, horizontal force and total\\nforce of the magnetic needle.\\nA squall strikes the ship. Two blasts of the whistle fetches the watch\\nout, and \\"Stand by topsail halyards,\\" \\"In inner jib,\\" sends one hand to\\none halyard, the midshipman of the watch to the other, and the rest on to\\nfoc\'stle and to the jib downhaul. Down comes the jib and the man standing\\nby the fore topsail halyard, which is on the weather side of the galley,\\nis drenched by the crests of two big seas which come over the rail.\\nBut he has little time to worry about things like this, for the wind is\\nincreasing and \\"Let go topsail halyards\\" comes through the megaphone from\\nthe bridge, and he wants all his wits to let go the halyard from the\\nbelaying-pins and jump clear of the rope tearing through the block as the\\ntopsail yard comes sliding down the mast.\\n\\"Clew up\\" is the next order, and then \\"All hands furl fore and main upper\\ntopsails,\\" and up we go out on to the yard. Luckily the dawn is just\\nturning the sea grey and the ratlines begin to show up in relief. It is\\nfar harder for the first and middle watches, who have to go aloft in\\ncomplete darkness. Once on the yard you are flattened against it by the\\nwind. The order to take in sail always fetches Pennell out of his\\nchart-house to come and take a hand.\\nThe two sodden sails safely furled--luckily they are small ones--the men\\nreach the deck to find that the wind has shifted a little farther aft and\\nthey are to brace round. This finished, it is broad daylight, and the men\\nset to work to coil up preparatory to washing decks--not that this would\\nseem very necessary. Certainly there is no hose wanted this morning, and\\na general kind of tidying up and coiling down ropes is more what is done.","image":"C02.01.jpeg"},{"merge":"C02.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The crew of the Terra Nova battles with the daily task of pumping water from the bilges, caused by leaks and coal dust.

All hands on the\\npumps!\\"\\nFrom first to last these pumps were a source of much exercise and hearty\\ncurses. A wooden ship always leaks a little, but the amount of water\\ntaken in by the Terra Nova even in calm weather was extraordinary, and\\ncould not be traced until the ship was dry-docked in Lyttelton, New\\nZealand, and the forepart was flooded.\\nIn the meantime the ship had to be kept as dry as possible, a process\\nwhich was not facilitated by forty gallons of oil which got loose during\\nthe rough weather after leaving South Trinidad, and found its way into\\nthe bilges. As we found later, some never-to-be-sufficiently-cursed\\nstevedore had left one of the bottom boards only half-fitted into its\\nneighbours. In consequence the coal dust and small pieces of coal, which\\nwas stowed in this hold, found their way into the bilges. Forty gallons\\nof oil completed the havoc and the pumps would gradually get more and\\nmore blocked until it was necessary to send for Davies, the carpenter, to\\ntake parts of them to pieces and clear out the oily coal balls which had\\nstopped them. This pumping would sometimes take till nearly eight, and\\nthen would always have to be repeated again in the evening, and sometimes\\nevery watch had to take a turn. At any rate it was good for our muscles.\\nThe pumps were placed amidships, just abaft the main mast, and ran down a\\nshaft adjoining the after hatch, which led into the holds which were\\ngenerally used for coal and patent fuel. The spout of the pump opened\\nabout a foot above the deck, and the plungers were worked by means of\\ntwo horizontal handles, much as a bucket is wound up on the drum of a\\ncottage well. Unfortunately, this part of the main deck, which is just\\nforward of the break of the poop, is more subject to seas breaking\\ninboard than any other part of the ship, so when the ship was labouring\\nthe task of those on the pump was not an enviable one. During the big\\ngale going South the water was up to the men\'s waists as they tried to\\nturn the handles, and the pumps themselves were feet under water.\\nFrom England to Cape Town these small handles were a great inconvenience.\\nThere was very much pumping to be done and there were plenty of men to do\\nit, but the handles were not long enough to allow more than four men to\\neach handle. Also they gave no secure purchase when the ship was rolling\\nheavily, and when a big roll came there was nothing to do but practically\\nstop pumping and hold on, or you found yourself in the scuppers.\\nAt Cape Town a great improvement was made by extending the crank handles\\nright across the decks, the outside end turning in a socket under the\\nrail. Fourteen men could then get a good purchase on the handles and\\npumping became a more pleasant exercise and less of a nuisance.\\nPeriodically the well was sounded by an iron rod being lowered on the end\\nof a rope, by which the part that came up wet showed the depth of water\\nleft in the bilge. When this had been reduced to about a foot in the\\nwell, the ship was practically dry, and the afterguard free to bathe and\\ngo to breakfast.\\nMeanwhile the hands of the watch had been employed on ropes and sails as\\nthe wind made necessary, and, when running under steam as well as sail,\\nhoisting ashes up the two shoots from the ash-pits of the furnaces to the\\ndeck, whence they went into the ditch.\\nIt is eight bells (8 o\'clock) and the two stewards are hurrying along the\\ndecks, hoping to get the breakfast safely from galley to wardroom. A few\\nnaked officers are pouring sea-water over their heads on deck, for we are\\nunder sail alone and there is no steam to work the hose. The watch\\nkeepers and their snotties of the night before are tumbling out of their\\nbunks, and a great noise of conversation is coming from the wardroom,\\namong which some such remarks as: \\"Give the jam a wind, Marie\\"; \\"After\\nyou with the coffee\\"; \\"Push along the butter\\" are frequent. There are few\\ncobwebs that have not been blown away by breakfast-time.\\nRennick is busy breakfasting preparatory to relieving Campbell on the\\nbridge. Meanwhile, the hourly and four-hourly ship\'s log is being made\\nup--force of the wind, state of the sea, height of the barometer, and all\\nthe details which a log has to carry--including a reading of the distance\\nrun as shown by the patent log line--(many is the time I have forgotten\\nto take it just at the hour and have put down what I thought it ought to\\nbe, and not what it was).\\nThe morning watch is finished.\\nSuddenly there is a yell from somewhere amidships--\\"STEADY\\"--a stranger\\nmight have thought there was something wrong, but it is a familiar sound,\\nanswered by a \\"STEADY IT IS, Sir,\\" from the man at the wheel, and an\\nanything but respectful, \\"One--two--three--STEADY,\\" from everybody having\\nbreakfast. It is Pennell who has caused this uproar. And the origin is as\\nfollows:\\nPennell is the navigator, and the standard compass, owing to its\\nremoteness from iron in this position, is placed on the top of the\\nice-house. The steersman, however, steers by a binnacle compass placed\\naft in front of his wheel. But these two compasses for various reasons do\\nnot read alike at a given moment, while the standard is the truer of the\\ntwo.\\nAt intervals, then, Pennell or the officer of the watch orders the\\nsteersman to \\"Stand by for a steady,\\" and goes up to the standard\\ncompass, and watches the needle. Suppose the course laid down is S. 40 E.\\nA liner would steer almost true to this course unless there was a big\\nwind or sea. But not so the old Terra Nova. Even with a good steersman\\nthe needle swings a good many degrees either side of the S. 40 E. But as\\nit steadies momentarily on the exact course Pennell shouts his \\"Steady,\\"\\nthe steersman reads just where the needle is pointing on the compass\\ncard before him, say S. 47 E., and knows that this is the course which is\\nto be steered by the binnacle compass.\\nPennell\'s yells were so frequent and ear-piercing that he became famous\\nfor them, and many times in working on the ropes in rough seas and big\\nwinds, we have been cheered by this unmusical noise over our heads.\\nWe left Simon\'s Bay on Friday, September 2, \'to make our Easting down\'\\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to New Zealand, that famous passage in the\\nRoaring Forties which can give so much discomfort or worse to sailing\\nships on their way.\\nSouth Africa had been hospitable. The Admiral Commanding the Station, the\\nNaval Dockyard, and H.M.S. Mutine and H.M.S. Pandora, had been more than\\nkind.

A. Wilson, del.]\\nThe big swell which so often prevails in these latitudes is a most\\ninspiring sight, and must be seen from a comparatively small ship like\\nthe Terra Nova for its magnitude to be truly appreciated. As the ship\\nrose on the crest of one great hill of water the next big ridge was\\nnearly a mile away, with a sloping valley between. At times these seas\\nare rounded in giant slopes as smooth as glass; at others they curl over,\\nleaving a milk-white foam, and their slopes are marbled with a beautiful\\nspumy tracery. Very wonderful are these mottled waves: with a following\\nsea, at one moment it seems impossible that the great mountain which is\\novertaking the ship will not overwhelm her, at another it appears\\ninevitable that the ship will fall into the space over which she seems to\\nbe suspended and crash into the gulf which lies below.\\nBut the seas are so long that they are neither dangerous nor\\nuncomfortable--though the Terra Nova rolled to an extraordinary extent,\\nquite constantly over 50\xb0 each way, and sometimes 55\xb0.\\nThe cooks, however, had a bad time trying to cook for some fifty hands in\\nthe little galley on the open deck. Poor Archer\'s efforts to make bread\\nsometimes ended in the scuppers, and the occasional jangle of the ship\'s\\nbell gave rise to the saying that \\"a moderate roll rings the bell, and a\\nbig roll brings out the cook.\\"\\nNoon on Sunday, September 18, found us in latitude 39\xb0 20\xb4 S. and\\nlongitude 66\xb0 9\xb4 E., after a very good run, for the Terra Nova, of 200\\nmiles in the last twenty-four hours. This made us about two days\' run\\nfrom St. Paul, an uninhabited island formed by the remains of an old\\nvolcano, the crater of which, surrounded as it were by a horse-shoe of\\nland, forms an almost landlocked harbour. It was hoped to make a landing\\nhere for scientific work, but it is a difficult harbour to make. We ran\\nanother two hundred miles on Monday, and on Tuesday all preparations were\\nmade for the landing, with suitable equipment, and we were not a little\\nexcited at the opportunity.\\nAt 4.30 A.M. the next morning all hands were turned out to take in sail\\npreparatory to rounding St. Paul which was just visible. The weather was\\nsqually, but not bad. By 5 A.M., however, it was blowing a moderate gale,\\nand by the time we had taken in all sail we had to give up hopes of a\\nlanding. We were thoroughly sick of sails by the time we finally reefed\\nthe foresail and ran before the wind under this and lower topsails.\\nWe passed quite close to the island and could see into the crater, and\\nthe cliffs beyond which rose from it, covered with greenish grass. There\\nwere no trees, and of birds we only saw those which frequent these seas.\\nWe had hoped to find penguins and albatross nesting on the island at this\\ntime of the year, and this failure to land was most disappointing. The\\nisland is 860 feet high, and, for its size, precipitous. It extends some\\ntwo miles in length and one mile in breadth.\\nThe following day all the afterguard were turned on to shift coal. It\\nshould be explained that up to this time the bunkers, which lay one on\\nthe port and the other on the starboard side of the furnaces, had been\\nentirely filled as required by two or more officers who volunteered from\\nday to day.\\nWe took on board 450 tons of Crown Patent Fuel at Cardiff in June 1910.\\nThis coal is in the form of bricks, and is most handy since it can be\\nthrown by hand from the holds through the bunker doors in the boiler-room\\nbulkhead which after a time was left higher than the sinking level of the\\ncoal. The coal to be landed was this patent fuel, and it was now decided\\nto shift farther aft all the patent fuel which was left, and stack it\\nagainst the boiler-room bulkhead, the coal which was originally there\\nhaving been fed to the furnaces. Thus the dust which was finding its way\\nthrough the floorboards, and choking the pumps, could be swept up, and a\\ngood stow could be made preparatory to the final fit-out in New Zealand,\\nwhile the coal which was to be taken on board at Lyttelton could be\\nloaded through the main hatch.\\nIn the meantime the gale which had sprung up six days before and\\nprevented us landing had died down. After leaving St. Paul we had let the\\nfires out and run under sail alone, and the following two days we ran 119\\nand 141 miles respectively, being practically becalmed at times on the\\nfollowing day, and only running 66 miles.\\nBy Tuesday night, September 27, we had finished the coaling, and we\\ncelebrated the occasion by a champagne dinner. At the same time we raised\\nsteam. Scott was anxious to push on, and so indeed was everybody else.\\nBut the wind was not disposed to help us, and headed us a good deal\\nduring the next few days, and it was not until October 2 that we were\\nable to set all plain sail in the morning watch.\\nThis absence of westerly winds in a region in which they are usually too\\nstrong for comfort was explained by Pennell by a theory that we were\\ntravelling in an anticyclone, which itself was travelling in front of a\\ncyclone behind us. We were probably moving under steam about the same\\npace as the disturbance, which would average some 150 miles a day.\\nFrom this may be explained many of the reports of continual bad weather\\nmet by sailing ships and steamers in these latitudes. If we had been a\\nsailing ship without auxiliary steam the cyclone would have caught us up,\\nand we should have been travelling with it, and consequently in continual\\nbad weather. On the other hand, a steamer pure and simple would have\\nsteamed through good and bad alike. But we, with our auxiliary steam,\\nonly made much the same headway as the disturbance travelling in our\\nwake, and so remained in the anticyclone.\\nPhysical observations were made on the outward voyage by Simpson and\\nWright[36] into the atmospheric electricity over the ocean, one set of\\nwhich consisted of an inquiry into the potential gradient, and\\nobservations were undertaken at Melbourne for the determination of the\\nabsolute value of the potential gradient over the sea.[37] Numerous\\nobservations were also made on the radium content of the atmosphere over\\nthe ocean, to be compared afterwards with observations in the Antarctic\\nair. The variations in radium content were not large. Results were also\\nobtained on the voyage of the Terra Nova to New Zealand upon the subject\\nof natural ionization in closed vessels.\\nIn addition to the work of the ship and the physical work above\\nmentioned, work in vertebrate zoology, marine biology and magnetism,\\ntogether with four-hourly observations of the salinity and temperature of\\nthe sea, was carried out during the whole voyage.\\nIn vertebrate zoology Wilson kept an accurate record of birds, and he and\\nLillie another record of whales and dolphins. All the birds which could\\nbe caught, both at sea and on South Trinidad Island, were skinned and\\nmade up into museum specimens. They were also examined for external and\\ninternal parasites by Wilson, Atkinson and myself, as were also such fish\\nand other animals as could be caught, including flying fish, a shark, and\\nlast but not least, whales in New Zealand.\\nThe method of catching these birds may be worth describing. A bent nail\\nwas tied to a line, the other end of which was made fast to the halyards\\nover the stern. Sufficient length of line was allowed either to cause the\\nnail to just trail in the sea in the wake of the ship or for the line to\\njust clear the sea. Thus when the halyard was hoisted to some thirty or\\nforty feet above the deck, the line would be covering a considerable\\ndistance of sea.\\nThe birds flying round the ship congregate for the main part in the wake,\\nfor here they find the scraps thrown overboard on which they feed.

Sometimes they will hit the line with the tips\\nof their wings, and then there is no resulting capture, but sooner or\\nlater a bird will touch the line with the part of the wing above the\\nelbow-joint (humerus). It seems that on feeling the contact the bird\\nsuddenly wheels in the air, thereby causing a loop in the line which\\ntightens round the bone. At any rate the next thing that happens is that\\nthe bird is struggling on the line and may be hauled on board.\\nThe difficulty is to get a line which is light enough to fly in the air,\\nbut yet strong enough to hold the large birds, such as albatross, without\\nbreaking. We tried fishing line with no success, but eventually managed\\nto buy some 5-ply extra strong cobbler\'s thread, which is excellent for\\nthe purpose. But we wanted not only specimens, but also observations of\\nthe species, the numbers which appeared, and their habits, for little is\\nknown as yet of these sea birds. And so we enlisted the help of all who\\nwere interested, and it may be said that all the officers and many of the\\nseamen had a hand in producing the log of sea birds, to which additions\\nwere made almost hourly throughout the daylight hours. Most officers and\\nmen knew the more common sea birds in the open ocean, and certainly of\\nthose in the pack and fringes of the Antarctic continent, which, with\\nrare exceptions, is the southern limit of bird life.\\nA number of observations of whales, illustrated by Wilson, were made, but\\nthe results so far as the seas from England to the Cape and New Zealand\\nare concerned, are not of great importance, partly because close views\\nwere seldom obtained, and partly because the whales inhabiting these seas\\nare fairly well known. On October 3, 1910, in latitude 42\xb0 17\xb4 S. and\\nlongitude 111\xb0 18\xb4 E., two adults of Balaenoptera borealis (Northern\\nRorqual) were following the ship close under the counter, length 50 feet,\\nwith a light-coloured calf some 18-20 feet long swimming with them. It\\nwas established by this and by a later observation in New Zealand, when\\nLillie helped to cut up a similar whale at the Norwegian Whaling Station\\nat the Bay of Islands, that this Rorqual which frequents the\\nsub-Antarctic seas is identical with our Northern Rorqual;[38] but this\\nwas the only close observation of any whales obtained before we left New\\nZealand.\\nGeneral information with regard to such animals is useful, however, as\\nshowing the relative abundance of plankton on which the whales feed in\\nthe ocean. There are, for instance, more whales in the Antarctic than in\\nwarmer seas; and some whales at any rate (e.g. Humpback whales) probably\\ncome north into warmer waters in the winter rather for breeding purposes\\nthan to get food.[39]\\nWith regard to dolphins four species were observed beyond question. The\\nrarest dolphin seen was Tersio peronii, the peculiarity of which is that\\nit has no dorsal fin. This was seen on October 20, 1910, in latitude 42\xb0\\n51\xb4 S. and longitude 153\xb0 56\xb4 E.\\nReports of whales and dolphins which are not based upon carcases and\\nskeletons must be accepted with caution. It is most difficult to place\\nspecies with scientific accuracy which can only be observed swimming in\\nthe water, and of which more often than not only blows and the dorsal\\nfins can be observed. The nomenclature of dolphins especially leaves much\\nto be desired, and it is to be hoped that some expedition in the future\\nwill carry a Norwegian harpooner, who could do other work as well since\\nthey are very good sailors. Wilson was strongly of this opinion and tried\\nhard to get a harpooner, but they are expensive people so long as the\\npresent boom in whaling lasts, and perhaps it was on the score of expense\\nthat the idea was regretfully abandoned. We carried whaling gear formerly\\ntaken on the Discovery Expedition, and kindly lent for this expedition by\\nthe Royal Geographical Society of London. A few shots were tried, but an\\nunskilled harpooner stands very little chance. If you go whaling you must\\nhave had experience.\\nThe ship was not slowed down to enable marine biological observations to\\nbe taken on this part of the expedition, but something like forty samples\\nof plankton were taken with a full-speed net. We were unable to trawl on\\nthe bottom until we reached Melbourne, when a trawl was made in Port\\nPhillip Harbour to try the gear and accustom men to its use. It was not a\\npurpose of the expedition to spend time in deep-sea work until it reached\\nAntarctic seas.\\nFor four days the wind, such as there was of it, was dead ahead; it is\\nnot very often in the Forties that a ship cannot make progress for want\\nof wind. But having set all plain sail on October 2 with a falling glass\\nwe got a certain amount of wind on the port beam, and did 158 miles in\\nthe next twenty-four hours. Sunday being quiet Scott read service while\\nthe officers and men grouped round the wheel. We seldom had service on\\ndeck; for Sundays became proverbial days for a blow on the way out, and\\nservice, if held at all, was generally in the ward-room. On one famous\\noccasion we tried to play the pianola to accompany the hymns, but, since\\nthe rolls were scored rather for musical effect than for church services,\\nthe pianola was suddenly found to be playing something quite different\\nfrom what was being sung. All through the expedition the want of some one\\nwho could play the piano was felt, and such a man is certainly a great\\nasset in a life so far removed from all the pleasures of civilization.\\nAs Scott wrote in The Voyage of the Discovery, where one of the officers\\nused to play each evening: \\"This hour of music has become an institution\\nwhich none of us would willingly forgo. I don\'t know what thoughts it\\nbrings to others, though I can readily guess; but of such things one does\\nnot care to write. I can well believe, however, that our music smooths\\nover many a ruffle and brings us to dinner each night in that excellent\\nhumour, where all seem good-tempered, though \'cleared for action\' and\\nready for fresh argument.\\"\\nThe wind freshened to our joy; Scott was impatient; there was much to be\\ndone and the time for doing it was not too long, for it had been decided\\nto leave New Zealand at an earlier date than had been attempted by any\\nprevious expedition, in order to penetrate the pack sooner and make an\\nearly start on the dep\xf4t journey. The faintest glow of the Aurora\\nAustralis which was to become so familiar to us was seen at this time,\\nbut what aroused still more interest was the capture of several albatross\\non the lines flowing out over the stern.\\nThe first was a \'sooty\' (cornicoides). We put him down on the deck, where\\nhe strutted about in the proudest way, his feet going flop--flop--flop as\\nhe walked. He was a most beautiful bird, sooty black body, a great black\\nhead with a line of white over each eye and a gorgeous violet line\\nrunning along his black beak. He treated us with the greatest contempt,\\nwhich, from such a beautiful creature, we had every appearance of\\ndeserving. Another day a little later we caught a wandering albatross, a\\nblack-browed albatross, and a sooty albatross all together, and set them\\non the deck tethered to the ventilators while their photographs were\\ntaken. They were such beautiful birds that we were loath to kill them,\\nbut their value as scientific specimens outweighed the wish to set them\\nfree, and we gave them ether so that they did not suffer.\\nThe Southern Ocean is the home of these and many species of birds, but\\namong them the albatross is pre-eminent. It has been mentioned that\\nWilson believed that the albatross, at any rate, fly round and round the\\nworld over these stormy seas before the westerly winds, landing but once\\na year on such islands as Kerguelen, St. Paul, the Auckland Islands and\\nothers to breed. If so, the rest that they can obtain upon the big\\nbreaking rollers which prevail in these latitudes must be unsatisfactory\\njudged by the standard of more civilized birds. I have watched sea birds\\nelsewhere of which the same individuals appeared to follow the ship day\\nafter day for many thousands of miles, but on this voyage I came to the\\nconclusion that a different set of birds appeared each morning, and that\\nthey were hungry when they arrived. Certainly they flew astern and nearer\\nto the ship in the morning, feeding on the scraps thrown overboard. As\\nthe day went on and the birds\' hunger was satisfied, they scattered, and\\nsuch of them as continued to fly astern of the ship were a long way off.\\nHence we caught the birds in the early morning, and only one bird was\\ncaught after mid-day.","image":"C02.04.jpeg"},{"merge":"C02.05","output":"The ship faces a big squall that causes damage to the topgallant yard and sail, but the crew manages to avoid a worse outcome.

On Friday,\\nOctober 7, we were doing 7.8 knots under sail alone, which was very good\\nfor the old Terra Push, as she was familiarly called: and we were then\\njust 1000 miles from Melbourne. By Saturday night we were standing by\\ntopgallant halyards. Campbell took over the watch at 4 A.M. on Sunday\\nmorning. It was blowing hard and squally, but the ship still carried\\ntopgallants. There was a big following sea.\\nAt 6.30 A.M. there occurred one of those incidents of sea life which are\\ninteresting though not important. Quite suddenly the first really big\\nsquall we had experienced on the voyage struck us. Topgallant halyards\\nwere let go, and the fore topgallant yard came down, but the main\\ntopgallant yard jammed when only half down. It transpired afterwards that\\na gasket which had been blown over the yard had fouled the block of the\\nsheet of the main upper topsail. The topgallant yard was all tilted to\\nstarboard and swaying from side to side, the sail seemed as though it\\nmight blow out at any moment, and was making a noise like big guns, and\\nthe mast was shaking badly.\\nIt was expected that the topgallant mast would go, but nothing could be\\ndone while the full fury of the wind lasted. Campbell paced quietly up\\nand down the bridge with a smile on his face. The watch was grouped round\\nthe ratlines ready to go aloft, and Crean volunteered to go up alone and\\ntry and free the yard, but permission was refused. It was touch and go\\nwith the mast and there was nothing to be done.\\nThe squall passed, the sail was freed and furled, and the next big squall\\nfound us ready to lower upper topsails and all was well. Finally the\\ndamage was a split sail and a strained mast.\\nThe next morning a new topgallant sail was bent, but quite the biggest\\nhailstorm I have ever seen came on in the middle of the operation. Much\\nof the hail must have been inches in circumference, and hurt even through\\nthick clothes and oilskins. At the same time there were several\\nwaterspouts formed. The men on the topgallant yard had a beastly time.\\nBelow on deck men made hail-balls and pretended they were snow.\\nFrom now onwards we ran on our course before a gale. By the early morning\\nof October 12 Cape Otway light was in sight. Working double tides in the\\nengine-room, and with every stitch of sail set, we just failed to reach\\nPort Phillip Heads by mid-day, when the tide turned, and it was\\nimpossible to get through. We went up Melbourne Harbour that evening,\\nvery dark and blowing hard.\\nA telegram was waiting for Scott:\\n    \\"Madeira. Am going South. AMUNDSEN.\\"\\nThis telegram was dramatically important, as will appear when we come to\\nthe last act of the tragedy. Captain Roald Amundsen was one of the most\\nnotable of living explorers, and was in the prime of life--forty-one, two\\nyears younger than Scott. He had been in the Antarctic before Scott, with\\nthe Belgica Expedition in 1897-99, and therefore did not consider the\\nSouth Pole in any sense our property. Since then he had realized the\\ndream of centuries of exploration by passing through the North-West\\nPassage, and actually doing so in a 60-ton schooner in 1905. The last we\\nhad heard of him was that he had equipped Nansen\'s old ship, the Fram,\\nfor further exploration in the Arctic. This was only a feint. Once at\\nsea, he had told his men that he was going south instead of north; and\\nwhen he reached Madeira he sent this brief telegram, which meant, \\"I\\nshall be at the South Pole before you.\\" It also meant, though we did not\\nappreciate it at the time, that we were up against a very big man.\\nThe Admiral Commanding the Australian Station came on board. The event of\\nthe inspection was Nigger, the black ship\'s cat, distinguished by a white\\nwhisker on the port side of his face, who made one adventurous voyage to\\nthe Antarctic and came to an untimely end during the second. The seamen\\nmade a hammock for him with blanket and pillow, and slung it forward\\namong their own bedding. Nigger had turned in, not feeling very well,\\nowing to the number of moths he had eaten, the ship being full of them.\\nWhen awakened by the Admiral, Nigger had no idea of the importance of the\\noccasion, but stretched himself, yawned in the most natural manner,\\nturned over and went to sleep again.\\nThis cat became a well-known and much photographed member of the crew of\\nthe Terra Nova. He is said to have imitated the Romans of old, being a\\ngreedy beast, by having eaten as much seal blubber as he could hold, made\\nhimself sick, and gone back and resumed his meal. He had most beautiful\\nfur. When the ship was returning from the Antarctic in 1911 Nigger was\\nfrightened by something on deck and jumped into the sea, which was\\nrunning fairly rough. However, the ship was hove to, a boat lowered, and\\nNigger was rescued. He spent another happy year on board, but disappeared\\none dark night when the ship was returning from her second journey to the\\nSouth in 1912, during a big gale. He often went aloft with the men, of\\nhis own accord. This night he was seen on the main lower topsail yard,\\nhigher than which he never would go. He disappeared in a big squall,\\nprobably because the yard was covered with ice.\\nWilson rejoined the ship at Melbourne; and Scott left her, to arrange\\nfurther business matters, and to rejoin in New Zealand. When he landed I\\nthink he had seen enough of the personnel of the expedition to be able to\\npass a fair judgment upon them. I cannot but think that he was pleased.\\nSuch enthusiasm and comradeship as prevailed on board could bear only\\ngood fruit. It would certainly have been possible to find a body of men\\nwho could work a sailing ship with greater skill, but not men who were\\nmore willing, and that in the midst of considerable discomfort, to work\\nhard at distasteful jobs and be always cheerful. And it must have been\\nclear that with all the energy which was being freely expended, the\\nexpedition came first, and the individual nowhere. It is to the honour of\\nall concerned that from the time it left London to the time it returned\\nto New Zealand after three years, this spirit always prevailed.\\nAmong the executive officers Scott was putting more and more trust in\\nCampbell, who was to lead the Northern Party. He was showing those\\ncharacteristics which enabled him to bring his small party safely through\\none of the hardest winters that men have ever survived. Bowers also had\\nshown seamanlike qualities which are an excellent test by which to judge\\nthe Antarctic traveller; a good seaman in sail will probably make a\\nuseful sledger: but at this time Scott can hardly have foreseen that\\nBowers was to prove \\"the hardest traveller that ever undertook a Polar\\njourney, as well as one of the most undaunted.\\" But he had already proved\\nhimself a first-rate sailor. Among the junior scientific staff too,\\nseveral were showing qualities as seamen which were a good sign for the\\nfuture. Altogether I think it must have been with a cheerful mind that\\nScott landed in Australia.\\nWhen we left Melbourne for New Zealand we were all a bit stale, which was\\nnot altogether surprising, and a run ashore was to do us a world of good\\nafter five months of solid grind, crowded up in a ship which thought\\nnothing of rolling 50\xb0 each way. Also, though everything had been done\\nthat could be done to provide them, the want of fresh meat and\\nvegetables was being felt, and it was an excellent thing that a body of\\nmen, for whom every precaution against scurvy that modern science could\\nsuggest was being taken, should have a good course of antiscorbutic food\\nand an equally beneficial change of life before leaving civilization.\\nAnd so it was with some anticipation that on Monday morning, October 24,\\nwe could smell the land--New Zealand, that home of so many Antarctic\\nexpeditions, where we knew that we should be welcomed. Scott\'s Discovery,\\nShackleton\'s Nimrod, and now again Scott\'s Terra Nova have all in turn\\nbeen berthed at the same quay in Lyttelton, for aught I know at the same\\nNo. 5 Shed, into which they have spilled out their holds, and from which\\nthey have been restowed with the addition of all that New Zealand,\\nscorning payment, could give. And from there they have sailed, and\\nthither their relief ships have returned year after year. Scott\'s words\\nof the Discovery apply just as much to the Terra Nova. Not only did New\\nZealand do all in her power to help the expedition in an official\\ncapacity, but the New Zealanders welcomed both officers and men with open\\narms, and \\"gave them to understand that although already separated by\\nmany thousands of miles from their native land, here in this new land\\nthey would find a second home, and those who would equally think of them\\nin their absence, and welcome them on their return.\\"","image":"C02.05.jpeg"},{"merge":"C02.06","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The crew of the Terra Nova prepares for their trip to the South Pole, which involves extensive preparations with regards to the loading of the ship, stowing of food and gear, and construction of huts and stalls for ponies and dogs.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_1\\": \\"\\\\\\"Our good friend Miller,\\\\\\" wrote Scott, \\\\\\"attacked the leak and traced it to the stern.\\\\\\"\\",\\n\\"excerpt_2\\": \\"But the scene on the morning of Saturday, November 26, baffles description.

The\\nwind went ahead, and it was not until the morning of October 28 that we\\nsailed through Lyttelton Heads. The word had gone forth that we should\\nsail away on November 27, and there was much to be done in the brief\\nmonth that lay ahead.\\nThere followed four weeks of strenuous work into which was sandwiched a\\nconsiderable amount of play. The ship was unloaded, when, as usual, men\\nand officers acted alike as stevedores, and she was docked, that an\\nexamination for the source of the leak might be made by Mr. H. J. Miller\\nof Lyttelton, who has performed a like service for more than one\\nAntarctic ship. But the different layers of sheathing protecting a ship\\nwhich is destined to fight against ice are so complicated that it is a\\nvery difficult matter to find the origin of a leak. All that can be said\\nwith any certainty is that the point where the water appears inside the\\nskin of the ship is almost certainly not the locality in which it has\\npenetrated the outside sheathing. \\"Our good friend Miller,\\" wrote Scott,\\n\\"attacked the leak and traced it to the stern. We found the false stern\\nsplit, and in one case a hole bored for a long-stern through-bolt which\\nwas much too large for the bolt.... The ship still leaks but the water\\ncan now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a\\nquarter of an hour to twenty minutes.\\" This in Lyttelton; but in a not\\nfar distant future every pump was choked, and we were baling with three\\nbuckets, literally for our lives.\\nBowers\' feat of sorting and restowing not only the stores we had but the\\ncheese, butter, tinned foods, bacon, hams and numerous other products\\nwhich are grown in New Zealand, and which any expedition leaving that\\ncountry should always buy there in preference to carrying them through\\nthe tropics, was a masterstroke of clear-headedness and organization.\\nThese stores were all relisted before stowing and the green-banded or\\nNorthern Party and red-banded or Main Party stores were not only easily\\ndistinguishable, but also stowed in such a way that they were forthcoming\\nwithout difficulty at the right time and in their due order.\\nThe two huts which were to form the homes of our two parties down South\\nhad been brought out in the ship and were now erected on a piece of waste\\nground near, by the same men who would be given the work to do in the\\nSouth.\\nThe gear peculiar to the various kinds of scientific work which it was\\nthe object of the expedition to carry out was also stowed with great\\ncare. The more bulky objects included a petrol engine and small dynamo, a\\nvery delicate instrument for making pendulum observations to test the\\ngravity of the earth, meteorological screens, and a Dines anemometer.\\nThere was also a special hut for magnetic observations, of which only the\\nframework was finally taken, with the necessary but bulky magnetic\\ninstruments. The biological and photographic gear was also of\\nconsiderable size.\\nFor the interior of the huts there were beds with spring mattresses--a\\nreal luxury but one well worth the space and money,--tables, chairs,\\ncooking ranges and piping, and a complete acetylene gas plant for both\\nparties. There were also extensive ventilators which were not a great\\nsuccess. The problem of ventilation in polar regions still remains to be\\nsolved.\\nFood can be packed into a comparatively small space, but not so fuel, and\\nthis is one of the greatest difficulties which confront the polar\\ntraveller. It must be conceded that in this respect Norway, with her\\nwonderful petrol-driven Fram, is far ahead of us. The Terra Nova depended\\non coal, and the length of the ship\'s stay in the South, and the amount\\nof exploration she could do after landing the shore parties, depended\\nalmost entirely upon how much coal she could be persuaded to hold after\\nall the necessaries of modern scientific exploration had been wedged\\ntightly into her.\\nThe Terra Nova sailed from New Zealand with 425 tons of coal in her holds\\nand bunkers, and 30 tons on deck in sacks. We were to hear more of those\\nsacks.\\nMeanwhile stalls were being built under the forecastle for fifteen\\nponies, and, since room could not be found below for the remaining four,\\nstalls were built on the port side of the fore hatch; the decks were\\ncaulked, and deck houses and other fittings which might carry away in the\\nstormy seas of the South were further secured.\\nAs the time of departure drew near, and each day of civilization appeared\\nto be more and more desirable, the scene in Lyttelton became animated and\\ncongested. Here is a scientist trying to force just one more case into\\nhis small laboratory, or decanting a mass of clothing, just issued, into\\nthe bottom of his bunk, to be slept on since there was no room for it on\\nthe deck of his cabin. On the main deck Bowers is trying to get one more\\nfrozen sheep into the ice-house, in the rigging working parties are\\noverhauling the running gear. The engine-room staff are busy on the\\nengine, and though the ship is crowded there is order everywhere, and it\\nis clean.\\nBut the scene on the morning of Saturday, November 26, baffles\\ndescription. There is no deck visible: in addition to 30 tons of coal in\\nsacks on deck there are 2\xbd tons of petrol, stowed in drums which in turn\\nare cased in wood. On the top of sacks and cases, and on the roof of the\\nice-house are thirty-three dogs, chained far enough apart to keep them\\nfrom following their first instinct--to fight the nearest animal they can\\nsee: the ship is a hubbub of howls. In the forecastle and in the four\\nstalls on deck are the nineteen ponies, wedged tightly in their wooden\\nstalls, and dwarfing everything are the three motor sledges in their huge\\ncrates, 16\xb4 x 5\xb4 x 4\xb4, two of them on either side of the main hatch, the\\nthird across the break of the poop. They are covered with tarpaulins and\\nsecured in every possible way, but it is clear that in a big sea their\\nweight will throw a great strain upon the deck. It is not altogether a\\ncheerful sight. But all that care and skill can do has been done to\\nensure that the deck cargo will not shift, and that the animals may be as\\nsheltered as possible from wind and seas. And it\'s no good worrying about\\nwhat can\'t be helped.\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n    [36] Vide _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. ii. pp. 454-456.\\n    [37] \\"Atmospheric Electricity over Ocean,\\" by G. C.

We were to call at\\nDunedin before leaving civilization, and arrived there on Sunday night.\\nHere we took on the remainder of our coal. On Monday night we danced, in\\nfantastic clothing for we had left our grand clothes behind, and sailed\\nfinally for the South the following afternoon amidst the greatest\\nenthusiasm. The wives remained with us until we reached the open sea.\\nAmongst those who only left us at the last minute was Mr. Kinsey of\\nChristchurch. He acted for Scott in New Zealand during the Discovery\\ndays, and for Shackleton in 1907. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude\\nfor his help. \\"His interest in the expedition is wonderful, and such\\ninterest on the part of a thoroughly shrewd business man is an asset of\\nwhich I have taken full advantage. Kinsey will act as my agent in\\nChristchurch during my absence; I have given him an ordinary power of\\nattorney, and I think have left him in possession of all the facts. His\\nkindness to us was beyond words.\\"[40]\\n\\"Evening.--Loom of land and Cape Saunders Light blinking.\\"[41]\\nThe ponies and dogs were the first consideration. Even in quite ordinary\\nweather the dogs had a wretched time. \\"The seas continually break on the\\nweather bulwarks and scatter clouds of heavy spray over the backs of all\\nwho must venture into the waist of the ship. The dogs sit with their\\ntails to this invading water, their coats wet and dripping. It is a\\npathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery; occasionally\\nsome poor beast emits a long pathetic whine. The group forms a picture of\\nwretched dejection; such a life is truly hard for these poor\\ncreatures.\\"[42]\\nThe ponies were better off. Four of them were on deck amidships and they\\nwere well boarded round. It is significant that these ponies had a much\\neasier time in rough weather than those in the bows of the ship. \\"Under\\nthe forecastle fifteen ponies close side by side, seven one side, eight\\nthe other, heads together, and groom between--swaying, swaying\\ncontinually to the plunging, irregular motion.\\"\\n\\"One takes a look through a hole in the bulkhead and sees a row of heads\\nwith sad, patient eyes come swinging up together from the starboard side,\\nwhilst those on the port swing back; then up come the port heads, while\\nthe starboard recede. It seems a terrible ordeal for these poor beasts to\\nstand this day after day for weeks together, and indeed though they\\ncontinue to feed well the strain quickly drags down their weight and\\ncondition; but nevertheless the trial cannot be gauged from human\\nstandards.\\"[43]\\nThe seas through which we had to pass to reach the pack-ice must be the\\nmost stormy in the world. Dante tells us that those who have committed\\ncarnal sin are tossed about ceaselessly by the most furious winds in the\\nsecond circle of Hell. The corresponding hell on earth is found in the\\nsouthern oceans, which encircle the world without break, tempest-tossed\\nby the gales which follow one another round and round the world from West\\nto East. You will find albatross there--great Wanderers, and Sooties,\\nand Mollymawks--sailing as lightly before these furious winds as ever do\\nPaolo and Francesca. Round the world they go. I doubt whether they land\\nmore than once a year, and then they come to the islands of these seas to\\nbreed.\\nThere are many other beautiful sea-birds, but most beautiful of all are\\nthe Snowy petrels, which approach nearer to the fairies than anything\\nelse on earth. They are quite white, and seemingly transparent. They are\\nthe familiar spirits of the pack, which, except to nest, they seldom if\\never leave, flying \\"here and there independently in a mazy fashion,\\nglittering against the blue sky like so many white moths, or shining\\nsnowflakes.\\"[44] And then there are the Giant petrels, whose coloration\\nis a puzzle. Some are nearly white, others brown, and they exhibit every\\nvariation between the one and the other. And, on the whole, the white\\nforms become more general the farther south you go. But the usual theory\\nof protective coloration will not fit in, for there are no enemies\\nagainst which this bird must protect itself. Is it something to do with\\nradiation of heat from the body?\\nA ship which sets out upon this journey generally has a bad time, and for\\nthis reason the overladen state of the Terra Nova was a cause of anxiety.\\nThe Australasian meteorologists had done their best to forecast the\\nweather we must expect. Everything which was not absolutely necessary had\\nbeen ruthlessly scrapped. Yet there was not a square inch of the hold and\\nbetween-decks which was not crammed almost to bursting, and there was as\\nmuch on the deck as could be expected to stay there. Officers and men\\ncould hardly move in their living quarters when standing up, and\\ncertainly they could not all sit down. To say that we were heavy laden is\\na very moderate statement of the facts.\\nThursday, December 1, we ran into a gale. We shortened sail in the\\nafternoon to lower topsails, jib and stay-sail. Both wind and sea rose\\nwith great rapidity, and before the night came our deck cargo had begun\\nto work loose. \\"You know how carefully everything had been lashed, but no\\nlashings could have withstood the onslaught of these coal sacks for\\nlong. There was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil, and nearly\\nall hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship, heaving coal\\nsacks overboard and re-lashing the petrol cases, etc., in the best manner\\npossible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances. The seas were\\ncontinually breaking over these people and now and again they would be\\ncompletely submerged. At such times they had to cling for dear life to\\nsome fixture to prevent themselves being washed overboard, and with coal\\nbags and loose cases washing about, there was every risk of such hold\\nbeing torn away.\\n\\"No sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally\\nheavy wave would tear away the lashing, and the work had to be done all\\nover again.\\"[45]\\nThe conditions became much worse during the night and things were\\ncomplicated for some of us by sea-sickness. I have lively recollections\\nof being aloft for two hours in the morning watch on Friday and being\\nsick at intervals all the time. For sheer downright misery give me a\\nhurricane, not too warm, the yard of a sailing ship, a wet sail and a\\nbout of sea-sickness.\\nIt must have been about this time that orders were given to clew up the\\njib and then to furl it. Bowers and four others went out on the bowsprit,\\nbeing buried deep in the enormous seas every time the ship plunged her\\nnose into them with great force. It was an education to see him lead\\nthose men out into that roaring inferno. He has left his own vivid\\nimpression of this gale in a letter home. His tendency was always to\\nunderestimate difficulties, whether the force of wind in a blizzard, or\\nthe troubles of a polar traveller. This should be remembered when reading\\nthe vivid accounts which his mother has so kindly given me permission to\\nuse:\\n\\"We got through the forties with splendid speed and were just over the\\nfifties when one of those tremendous gales got us. Our Lat. was about 52\xb0\\nS., a part of the world absolutely unfrequented by shipping of any sort,\\nand as we had already been blown off Campbell Island we had nothing but\\na clear sweep to Cape Horn to leeward. One realized then how in the\\nNimrod--in spite of the weather--they always had the security of a big\\nsteamer to look to if things came to the worst. We were indeed alone, by\\nmany hundreds of miles, and never having felt anxious about a ship\\nbefore, the old whaler was to give me a new experience.","image":"C03.01.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.02","output":"{\\n  \\"summary\\": \\"The ship is hit by a storm and water starts pouring in, threatening to sink it.

These, acting as battering-rams, tore\\nadrift some of my carefully stowed petrol cases and endangered the lot. I\\nhad started to make sail fast at 3 P.M. and it was 9.30 P.M. when I had\\nfinished putting on additional lashings to everything I could. So rapidly\\ndid the sea get up that one was continually afloat and swimming about. I\\nturned in for 2 hours and lay awake hearing the crash of the seas and\\nthinking how long those cases would stand it, till my watch came at\\nmidnight as a relief. We were under 2 lower topsails and hove to, the\\nengines going dead slow to assist keeping head to wind. At another time I\\nshould have been easy in my mind; now the water that came aboard was\\nsimply fearful, and the wrenching on the old ship was enough to worry any\\nsailor called upon to fill his decks with garbage fore and aft. Still\\n\'Risk nothing and do nothing,\' if funds could not supply another ship, we\\nsimply had to overload the one we had, or suffer worse things down south.\\nThe watch was eventful as the shaking up got the fine coal into the\\nbilges, and this mixing with the oil from the engines formed balls of\\ncoal and grease which, ordinarily, went up the pumps easily; now however\\nwith the great strains, and hundreds of tons on deck, as she continually\\nfilled, the water started to come in too fast for the half-clogged pumps\\nto cope with. An alternative was offered to me in going faster so as to\\nshake up the big pump on the main engines, and this I did--in spite of\\nmyself--and in defiance of the first principles of seamanship. Of course,\\nwe shipped water more and more, and only to save a clean breach of the\\ndecks did I slow down again and let the water gain. My next card was to\\nget the watch on the hand-pumps as well, and these were choked, too, or\\nnearly so.\\n\\"Anyhow with every pump,--hand and steam,--going, the water continued to\\nrise in the stokehold. At 4 A.M. all hands took in the fore lower\\ntopsail, leaving us under a minimum of sail. The gale increased to storm\\nforce (force 11 out of 12) and such a sea got up as only the Southern\\nFifties can produce. All the afterguard turned out and the pumps were\\nvigorously shaken up,--sickening work as only a dribble came out. We had\\nto throw some coal overboard to clear the after deck round the pumps, and\\nI set to work to rescue cases of petrol which were smashed adrift. I\\nbroke away a plank or two of the lee bulwarks to give the seas some\\noutlet as they were right over the level of the rail, and one was\\nconstantly on the verge of floating clean over the side with the cataract\\nforce of the backwash. I had all the swimming I wanted that day. Every\\ncase I rescued was put on the weather side of the poop to help get us on\\na more even keel. She sagged horribly and the unfortunate ponies,--though\\nunder cover,--were so jerked about that the weather ones could not keep\\ntheir feet in their stalls, so great was the slope and strain on their\\nforelegs. Oates and Atkinson worked among them like Trojans, but morning\\nsaw the death of one, and the loss of one dog overboard. The dogs, made\\nfast on deck, were washed to and fro, chained by the neck, and often\\nsubmerged for a considerable time. Though we did everything in our power\\nto get them up as high as possible, the sea went everywhere. The wardroom\\nwas a swamp and so were our bunks with all our nice clothing, books, etc.\\nHowever, of this we cared little, when the water had crept up to the\\nfurnaces and put the fires out, and we realized for the first time that\\nthe ship had met her match and was slowly filling. Without a pump to suck\\nwe started the forlorn hope of buckets and began to bale her out. Had we\\nbeen able to open a hatch we could have cleared the main pump well at\\nonce, but with those appalling seas literally covering her, it would\\nhave meant less than 10 minutes to float, had we uncovered a hatch.\\n\\"The Chief Engineer (Williams) and carpenter (Davies), after we had all\\nput our heads together, started cutting a hole in the engine room\\nbulkhead, to enable us to get into the pump-well from the engine room; it\\nwas iron and, therefore, at least a 12 hours job. Captain Scott was\\nsimply splendid, he might have been at Cowes, and to do him and Teddy\\nEvans credit, at our worst strait none of our landsmen who were working\\nso hard knew how serious things were. Capt. Scott said to me quietly--\'I\\nam afraid it\'s a bad business for us--What do you think?\' I said we were\\nby no means dead yet, though at that moment, Oates, at peril of his life,\\ngot aft to report another horse dead; and more down. And then an awful\\nsea swept away our lee bulwarks clean, between the fore and main\\nriggings,--only our chain lashings saved the lee motor sledge then, and I\\nwas soon diving after petrol cases. Captain Scott calmly told me that\\nthey \'did not matter\'--This was our great project for getting to the\\nPole--the much advertised motors that \'did not matter\'; our dogs looked\\nfinished, and horses were finishing, and I went to bale with a strenuous\\nprayer in my heart, and \'Yip-i-addy\' on my lips, and so we pulled through\\nthat day. We sang and re-sang every silly song we ever knew, and then\\neverybody in the ship later on was put on 2-hour reliefs to bale, as it\\nwas impossible for flesh to keep heart with no food or rest. Even the\\nfresh-water pump had gone wrong so we drank neat lime juice, or anything\\nthat came along, and sat in our saturated state awaiting our next spell.\\nMy dressing gown was my great comfort as it was not very wet, and it is a\\nlovely warm thing.\\n\\"To make a long yarn short, we found later in the day that the storm was\\neasing a bit and that though there was a terrible lot of water in the\\nship, which, try as we could, we could not reduce, it certainly had\\nceased to rise to any great extent. We had reason to hope then that we\\nmight keep her afloat till the pump wells could be cleared. Had the storm\\nlasted another day, God knows what our state would have been, if we had\\nbeen above water at all. You cannot imagine how utterly helpless we felt\\nin such a sea with a tiny ship,--the great expedition with all its hopes\\nthrown aside for its life. God had shown us the weakness of man\'s hand\\nand it was enough for the best of us,--the people who had been made such\\na lot of lately--the whole scene was one of pathos really. However, at 11\\nP.M. Evans and I with the carpenter were able to crawl through a tiny\\nhole in the bulkhead, burrow over the coal to the pump-well cofferdam,\\nwhere, another hole having been easily made in the wood, we got down\\nbelow with Davy lamps and set to work. The water was so deep that you had\\nto continually dive to get your hand on to the suction. After 2 hours or\\nso it was cleared for the time being and the pumps worked merrily. I went\\nin again at 4.30 A.M. and had another lap at clearing it. Not till the\\nafternoon of the following day, though, did we see the last of the water\\nand the last of the great gale. During the time the pumps were working,\\nwe continued the baling till the water got below the furnaces. As soon as\\nwe could light up, we did, and got the other pumps under weigh, and, once\\nthe ship was empty, clearing away the suction was a simple matter. I was\\npleased to find that after all I had only lost about 100 gallons of the\\npetrol and bad as things had been they might have been worse....\\n\\"You will ask where all the water came from seeing our forward leak had\\nbeen stopped. Thank God we did not have that to cope with as well. The\\nwater came chiefly through the deck where the tremendous strain,--not\\nonly of the deck load, but of the smashing seas,--was beyond conception.\\nShe was caught at a tremendous disadvantage and we were dependent for our\\nlives on each plank standing its own strain. Had one gone we would all\\nhave gone, and the great anxiety was not so much the existing water as\\nwhat was going to open up if the storm continued. We might have dumped\\nthe deck cargo, a difficult job at best, but were too busy baling to do\\nanything else....\\n\\"That Captain Scott\'s account will be moderate you may be sure. Still,\\ntake my word for it, he is one of the best, and behaved up to our best\\ntraditions at a time when his own outlook must have been the blackness of\\ndarkness....\\"\\nCharacteristically Bowers ends his account:\\n\\"Under its worst conditions this earth is a good place to live in.\\"\\nPriestley wrote in his diary:\\n\\"If Dante had seen our ship as she was at her worst, I fancy he would\\nhave got a good idea for another Circle of Hell, though he would have\\nbeen at a loss to account for such a cheerful and ribald lot of Souls.\\"\\nThe situation narrowed down to a fight between the incoming water and the\\nmen who were trying to keep it in check by baling her out. The Terra Nova\\nwill never be more full of water, nearly up to the furnaces, than she was\\nthat Friday morning, when we were told to go and do our damndest with\\nthree iron buckets. The constructors had not allowed for baling, only for\\nthe passage of one man at a time up and down the two iron ladders which\\nconnected the engine-room floor plates with the deck. If we used more\\nthan three buckets the business of passing them rapidly up, emptying them\\nout of the hatchway, and returning them empty, became unprofitable. We\\nwere divided into two gangs, and all Friday and Friday night we worked\\ntwo hours on and two hours off, like fiends.\\nWilson\'s Journal describes the scene:","image":"C03.02.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.03","output":"The passage describes the difficult and dangerous conditions faced by the crew of the Terra Nova ship as they navigated through high waves and pack ice on their journey south.

As this was full of coal and patent fuel and was\\nnext the engine-room, and as it had not been opened for the airing it\\nrequired to get rid of gas, on account of the flood of water on deck\\nmaking it impossible to open the hatchway, the possibility of a fire\\nthere was patent to every one, and it could not possibly have been dealt\\nwith in any way short of opening the hatches and flooding the ship, when\\nshe must have foundered. It was therefore a thrilling moment or two until\\nit was discovered that the smoke was really steam, arising from the bilge\\nat the bottom having risen to the heated coal.\\"[46]\\nMeanwhile men were working for all our lives to cut through two bulkheads\\nwhich cut off all communication with the suction of the hand-pumps.

One poor beast was found hanging\\nwhen dead; one was washed away with such force that his chain broke and\\nhe disappeared overboard; the next wave miraculously washed him on board\\nagain and he is fit and well. [I believe the dog was Osman.] The gale has\\nexacted heavy toll, but I feel all will be well if we can only cope with\\nthe water. Another dog has just been washed overboard--alas! Thank God\\nthe gale is abating. The sea is still mountainously high but the ship is\\nnot labouring so heavily as she was.\\"[47]\\nThe highest waves of which I can find any record were 36 feet high. These\\nwere observed by Sir James C. Ross in the North Atlantic.[48]\\nOn December 2 the waves were logged, probably by Pennell, who was\\nextremely careful in his measurements, as being \'thirty-five feet high\\n(estimated).\' At one time I saw Scott, standing on the weather rail of\\nthe poop, buried to his waist in green sea. The reader can then imagine\\nthe condition of things in the waist of the ship, \\"over and over again\\nthe rail, from the fore-rigging to the main, was covered by a solid sheet\\nof curling water which swept aft and high on the poop.\\"[49] At another\\ntime Bowers and Campbell were standing upon the bridge, and the ship\\nrolled sluggishly over until the lee combings of the main hatch were\\nunder the sea. They watched anxiously, and slowly she righted herself,\\nbut \\"she won\'t do that often,\\" said Bowers. As a rule if a ship gets that\\nfar over she goes down.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nOur journey was uneventful for a time, but of course it was not by any\\nmeans smooth. \\"I was much disturbed last night by the motion; the ship\\nwas pitching and twisting with short sharp movements on a confused sea,\\nand with every plunge my thoughts flew to our poor ponies. This afternoon\\nthey are fairly well, but one knows that they must be getting weaker as\\ntime goes on, and one longs to give them a good sound rest with a ship on\\nan even keel. Poor patient beasts! One wonders how far the memory of\\nsuch fearful discomfort will remain with them--animals so often remember\\nplaces and conditions where they have encountered difficulties or hurt.\\nDo they only recollect circumstances which are deeply impressed by some\\nshock of fear or sudden pain, and does the remembrance of prolonged\\nstrain pass away? Who can tell? But it would seem strangely merciful if\\nnature should blot out these weeks of slow but inevitable torture.\\"[50]\\nOn December 7, noon position 61\xb0 22\xb4 S., 179\xb0 56\xb4 W., one berg was\\nsighted far away to the west, as it gleamed every now and then in the\\nsun. Two more were seen the next day, and at 6.22 A.M. on December 9,\\nnoon position 65\xb0 8\xb4 S., 177\xb0 41\xb4 W., the pack was sighted ahead by\\nRennick. All that day we passed bergs and streams of ice. The air became\\ndry and bracing, the sea was calm, and the sun shining on the islands of\\nice was more than beautiful. And then Bump! We had just charged the first\\nbig floe, and we were in the pack.\\n\\"The sky has been wonderful, with every form of cloud in every condition\\nof light and shade; the sun has continually appeared through breaks in\\nthe cloudy heavens from time to time, brilliantly illuminating some field\\nof pack, some steep-walled berg, or some patch of bluest sea. So sunlight\\nand shadow have chased each other across our scene. To-night there is\\nlittle or no swell--the ship is on an even keel, steady, save for the\\noccasional shocks on striking ice.\\n\\"It is difficult to express the sense of relief this steadiness gives\\nafter our storm-tossed passage. One can only imagine the relief and\\ncomfort afforded to the ponies, but the dogs are visibly cheered and the\\nhuman element is full of gaiety. The voyage seems full of promise in\\nspite of the imminence of delay.\\"[51]\\nWe had met the pack farther north than any other ship.\\nWhat is pack? Speaking very generally indeed, in this region it is the\\nsea-ice which forms over the Ross Sea area during the winter, and is\\nblown northwards by the southerly blizzards. But as we shall see, the\\nice which forms over this area is of infinite variety. As a rule great\\nsheets spread over the seas which fringe the Antarctic continent in the\\nautumn, grow thicker and thicker during the winter and spring, and break\\nup when the temperatures of sea and air rise in summer. Such is the ice\\nwhich forms in normal seasons round the shores of McMurdo Sound, and up\\nthe coast of the western mountains of Victoria Land. In sheltered bays\\nthis ice will sometimes remain in for two years or even more, growing all\\nthe time, until some phenomenal break-up releases it. We found an example\\nof this in the sea-ice which formed between Hut Point and the Barrier.\\nBut there are great waters which can never freeze for very long. Cape\\nCrozier, for instance, where the Emperor penguins nest in winter, is one\\nof the windiest places in the world. In July it was completely frozen\\nover as far as we could see in the darkness from a height of 900 feet.\\nWithin a few days a hurricane had blown it all away, and the sea was\\nblack.\\nI believe, and we had experiences to prove me right, that there is a\\ncritical period early in the winter, and that if sea-ice has not frozen\\nthick enough to remain fast by that time, it is probable that the sea\\nwill remain open for the rest of the year. But this does not mean that no\\nice will form. So great is the wish of the sea to freeze, and so cold is\\nthe air, that the wind has only to lull for one instant and the surface\\nis covered with a thin film of ice, as though by magic. But the next\\nblizzard tears it out by force or a spring tide coaxes it out by stealth,\\nwhether it be a foot thick or only a fraction of an inch. Such an example\\nwe had at our very doors during our last winter, and the untamed winds\\nwhich blew as a result were atrocious.\\nThus it is that floes from a few inches to twenty feet thick go voyaging\\nout to join the belt of ice which is known as the pack.

By experience we know that clear\\nwater may be found in the autumn where great tracts of ice barred the way\\nin summer. The tendency of the pack is northwards, where the ice melts\\ninto the warmer waters. But the bergs remain when all traces of the pack\\nhave disappeared, and, drifting northwards still, form the menace to\\nshipping so well known to sailors rounding the Horn. It is not hard to\\nimagine that one monster ice island of twenty miles in length, such as do\\nhaunt these seas, drifting into navigated waters and calving into\\nhundreds of great bergs as it goes, will in itself produce what seamen\\ncall a bad year for ice. And the last stages of these, when the bergs\\nhave degenerated into \'growlers,\' are even worse, for then the sharpest\\neye can hardly distinguish them as they float nearly submerged though\\nthey have lost but little of their powers of evil.\\nThere are two main types of Antarctic berg. The first and most common is\\nthe tabular form. Bergs of this shape cruise about in thousands and\\nthousands. A less common form is known as the pinnacled berg, and in\\nalmost every case this is a tabular berg which has been weathered or has\\ncapsized. The number of bergs which calve direct from a mountain glacier\\ninto the sea is probably not very great. Whence then do they come?\\nThe origin of the tabular bergs was debated until a few years ago. They\\nhave been recorded up to forty and even fifty miles in length, and they\\nhave been called floe bergs, because it was supposed that they froze\\nfirst as ordinary sea-ice and increased by subsequent additions from\\nbelow. But now we know that these bergs calve off from the Antarctic\\nBarriers, the largest of which is known as the Great Ice Barrier, which\\nforms the southern boundary of the Ross Sea. We were to become very\\nfamiliar with this vast field of ice. We know that its northern face is\\nafloat, we guess that it may all be afloat. At any rate the open sea now\\nwashes against its face at least forty miles south of where it ran in\\nthe days of Ross. Though this Barrier may be the largest in the world, it\\nis one of many. The most modern review of this mystery, Scott\'s article\\non The Great Ice Barrier, must serve until the next first-hand\\nexamination by some future explorer.\\nA berg shows only about one-eighth of its total mass above water, and a\\nberg two hundred feet high will therefore reach approximately fourteen\\nhundred feet below the surface of the sea. Winds and currents have far\\nmore influence upon them than they have upon the pack, through which\\nthese bergs plough their way with a total disregard for such flimsy\\nobstacles, and cause much chaos as they go. For the rest woe betide the\\nship which is so fixed into the pack that she cannot move if one of these\\nmonsters bears down upon her.\\nWords cannot tell the beauty of the scenes through which we were to pass\\nduring the next three weeks. I suppose the pack in winter must be a\\nterrible place enough: a place of darkness and desolation hardly to be\\nfound elsewhere. But forms which under different conditions can only\\nbetoken horror now conveyed to us impressions of the utmost peace and\\nbeauty, for the sun had kissed them all.\\n\\"We have had a marvellous day. The morning watch was cloudy, but it\\ngradually cleared until the sky was a brilliant blue, fading on the\\nhorizon into green and pink. The floes were pink, floating in a deep blue\\nsea, and all the shadows were mauve. We passed right under a monster\\nberg, and all day have been threading lake after lake and lead after\\nlead. \'There is Regent Street,\' said somebody, and for some time we drove\\nthrough great streets of perpendicular walls of ice. Many a time they\\nwere so straight that one imagined they had been cut off with a ruler\\nsome hundreds of yards in length.\\"[53]\\n\\n[Illustration: MIDNIGHT--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nOn another occasion:\\n\\"Stayed on deck till midnight. The sun just dipped below the southern\\nhorizon. The scene was incomparable. The northern sky was gloriously rosy\\nand reflected in the calm sea between the ice, which varied from\\nburnished copper to salmon pink; bergs and pack to the north had a\\npale greenish hue with deep purple shadows, the sky shaded to saffron and\\npale green. We gazed long at these beautiful effects.\\"[54]\\nBut this was not always so. There was one day with rain, there were days\\nof snow and hail and cold wet slush, and fog. \\"The position to-night is\\nvery cheerless. All hope that this easterly wind will open the pack seems\\nto have vanished. We are surrounded with compacted floes of immense area.\\nOpenings appear between these floes and we slide crab-like from one to\\nanother with long delays between. It is difficult to keep hope alive.\\nThere are streaks of water sky over open leads to the north, but\\neverywhere to the south we have the uniform white sky. The day has been\\novercast and the wind force 3 to 5 from the E.N.E.--snow has fallen from\\ntime to time. There could scarcely be a more dreary prospect for the eye\\nto rest upon.\\"[55]\\nWith the open water we left behind the albatross and the Cape pigeon\\nwhich had accompanied us lately for many months. In their place we found\\nthe Antarctic petrel, \\"a richly piebald bird that appeared to be almost\\nblack and white against the ice floes,\\"[56] and the Snowy petrel, of\\nwhich I have already spoken.\\nNo one of us whose privilege it was to be there will forget our first\\nsight of the penguins, our first meal of seal meat, or that first big\\nberg along which we coasted close in order that London might see it on\\nthe film. Hardly had we reached the thick pack, which prevailed after the\\nsuburbs had been passed, when we saw the little Ad\xe9lie penguins hurrying\\nto meet us. Great Scott, they seemed to say, what\'s this, and soon we\\ncould hear the cry which we shall never forget. \\"Aark, aark,\\" they said,\\nand full of wonder and curiosity, and perhaps a little out of breath,\\nthey stopped every now and then to express their feelings, \\"and to gaze\\nand cry in wonder to their companions; now walking along the edge of a\\nfloe in search of a narrow spot to jump and so avoid the water, and with\\nhead down and much hesitation judging the width of the narrow gap, to\\ngive a little standing jump across as would a child, and running on the\\nfaster to make up for its delay. Again, coming to a wider lead of water\\nnecessitating a plunge, our inquisitive visitor would be lost for a\\nmoment, to reappear like a jack-in-the-box on a nearer floe, where\\nwagging his tail, he immediately resumed his race towards the ship. Being\\nnow but a hundred yards or so from us he pokes his head constantly\\nforward on this side and on that, to try and make out something of the\\nnew strange sight, crying aloud to his friends in his amazement, and\\nexhibiting the most amusing indecision between his desire for further\\ninvestigation and doubt as to the wisdom and propriety of closer contact\\nwith so huge a beast.\\"[57]\\nThey are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the\\nAntarctic world, either like children, or like old men, full of their own\\nimportance and late for dinner, in their black tail-coats and white\\nshirt-fronts--and rather portly withal. We used to sing to them, as they\\nto us, and you might often see \\"a group of explorers on the poop, singing\\n\'She has rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, and she shall have\\nmusic wherever she goes,\' and so on at the top of their voices to an\\nadmiring group of Ad\xe9lie penguins.\\"[58]\\nMeares used to sing to them what he called \'God save,\' and declared that\\nit would always send them headlong into the water. He sang flat: perhaps\\nthat was why.\\nTwo or more penguins will combine to push a third in front of them\\nagainst a skua gull, which is one of their enemies, for he eats their\\neggs or their young if he gets the chance. They will refuse to dive off\\nan ice-foot until they have persuaded one of their companions to take the\\nfirst jump, for fear of the sea-leopard which may be waiting in the water\\nbelow, ready to seize them and play with them much as a cat will play\\nwith a mouse. As Levick describes in his book about the penguins at Cape\\nAdare: \\"At the place where they most often went in, a long terrace of ice\\nabout six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge\\nof the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near\\nthe brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over,\\nall would crane their necks over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer\\nsafe in the water, the rest followed.\\"[59]","image":"C03.04.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.05","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the behavior and characteristics of Antarctic animals, including Ad\xe9lie and Emperor penguins, sea-leopards, Weddell and crab-eating seals.

With long\\npowerful head and neck and a sinuous body, it is equipped with most\\nformidable teeth with which it tears strips out of the still living\\nbirds, and flippers which are adapted entirely for speed in the water. It\\nis a solitary animal with a large range of distribution. It has been\\nsupposed to bring forth its young in the pack, but nothing definite is\\nknown on this subject. One day we saw a big sea-leopard swimming along\\nwith the ship. He dived under the floes and reappeared from floe to floe\\nas we went, and for a time we thought he was interested in us. But soon\\nwe sighted another lying away on a floe, and our friend in the water\\nbegan to rear his head up perpendicularly, and seemed to be trying to\\nwind his mate, as we supposed. He was down wind from her, and appeared to\\nfind her at a distance of 150 to 200 yards, and the last we saw of him he\\nwas heading up the side of the floe where she lay.\\nThere are four kinds of seal in the Antarctic; of one of these, the\\nsea-leopard, I have already spoken. Another is called the Ross seal, for\\nSir James Ross discovered it in 1840. It seems to be a solitary beast,\\nliving in the pack, and is peculiar for its \\"pug-like expression of\\ncountenance.\\"[61] It has always been rare, and no single specimen was\\nseen on this expedition, though the Terra Nova must have passed through\\nmore pack than most whalers see in a life-time. It looks as if the Ross\\nseal is more rare than was supposed.\\n[Illustration: A SEA LEOPARD]\\n[Illustration: A WEDDELL SEAL]\\nThe very common seal of the Antarctic is the Weddell, which seldom lives\\nin the pack but spends its life catching fish close to the shores of the\\ncontinent, and digesting them, when caught, lying sluggishly upon the\\nice-foot. We came to know them later in their hundreds in McMurdo Sound,\\nfor the Weddell is a land-loving seal and is only found in large numbers\\nnear the coast. Just at this time it was the crab-eating seal which we\\nsaw very fairly often, generally several of them together, but never in\\nlarge numbers.\\nWilson has pointed out in his article upon seals in the Discovery\\nReport[62] that the Weddell and the crab-eater seal, which are the two\\ncommoner of the Antarctic seals, have agreed to differ both in habit and\\nin diet, and therefore they share the field successfully. He shows that\\n\\"the two penguins which share the same area have differentiated in a\\nsomewhat similar manner.\\" The Weddell seal and the Emperor penguin \\"have\\nthe following points in common, namely, a littoral distribution, a fish\\ndiet and residential non-migratory habit, remaining as far south the\\nwhole year round as open water will allow; whereas the other two (the\\ncrab-eating seal and the Ad\xe9lie penguin) have in common a more pelagic\\nhabit, a crustacean diet, and a distribution definitely migratory in the\\ncase of the penguin, and although not so definitely migratory in the case\\nof the seal, yet checked from coming so far south as Weddell\'s seal in\\nwinter by a strong tendency to keep in touch with pelagic ice.\\"[63]\\nWilson considers that the advantage lies in each case with the\\n\\"non-migratory and more southern species,\\" i.e. the Weddell seal and\\nthe Emperor penguin. I doubt whether he would confirm this now. The\\nEmperor penguin, weighing six stones and more, seems to me to have a very\\nmuch harder fight for life than the little Ad\xe9lie.\\nBefore the Discovery started from England in 1901 an \'Antarctic Manual\'\\nwas produced by the Royal Geographical Society, giving a summary of the\\ninformation which existed up to that date about this part of the world.\\nIt is interesting reading, and to the Antarctic student it proves how\\nlittle was known in some branches of science at that date, and what\\nstrides were made during the next few years. To read what was known of\\nthe birds and beasts of the Antarctic and then to read Wilson\'s\\nZoological Report of the Discovery Expedition is an education in what one\\nman can still do in an out-of-the-way part of the world to elucidate the\\nproblems which await him.\\nThe teeth of a crab-eating seal \\"are surmounted by perhaps the most\\ncomplicated arrangement of cusps found in any living mammal.\\"[64] The\\nmouth is so arranged that the teeth of the upper jaw fit into those of\\nthe lower, and \\"the cusps form a perfect sieve ... a hitherto\\nunparalleled function for the teeth of a mammal.\\"[65] The food of this\\nseal consists mainly of Euphausiae, animals much like shrimps, which it\\ndoubtless keeps in its mouth while it expels the water through its teeth,\\nlike those whales which sift their food through their baleen plates.\\"\\nThis development of cusps in the teeth of the [crab-eating seal] is\\nprobably a more perfect adaptation to this purpose than in any other\\nmammal, and has been produced at the cost of all usefulness in the teeth\\nas grinders. The grit, however, which forms a fairly constant part of the\\ncontents of the stomach and intestines, serves, no doubt, to grind up the\\nshells of the crustaceans, and in this way the necessity for grinders is\\ncompletely obviated.\\"[66]\\nThe sea-leopard has a very formidable set of teeth suitable for his\\ncarnivorous diet. The Weddell, living on fish, has a more simple group,\\nbut these are liable to become very worn in old age, due to his habit of\\ngnawing out holes in the ice for himself, so graphically displayed on\\nPonting\'s cinematograph. When he feels death approaching, the crab-eating\\nseal, never inclined to live in the company of more than a few of his\\nkind, becomes still more solitary. The Weddell seal will travel far up\\nthe glaciers of South Victoria Land, and there we have found them lying\\ndead. But the crab-eating seal will wander even farther. He leaves the\\npack. \\"Thirty miles from the sea-shore and 3000 feet above sea-level,\\ntheir carcases were found on quite a number of occasions, and it is hard\\nto account for such vagaries on other grounds than that a sick animal\\nwill go any distance to get away from its companions\\"[67] (and perhaps it\\nshould be added from its enemies).","image":"C03.05.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.06","output":"The passage describes the diverse marine life, including the diatoms that form yellow coloration, various whale species, and methods of identifying whales through their blow and dorsal fins.

The\\nfloating life of the Antarctic is most dense. \\"Diatoms were so abundant\\nin parts of the Ross Sea, that a large plankton net (18 meshes to an\\ninch) became choked in a few minutes with them and other members of the\\nPhytoplankton.

Most common of all is the kind of sea-wolf\\nknown as the Killer Whale, who measures 30 feet long.

This whale is a toothed beast and a\\nflesh-eater, and is more properly a dolphin. But it seems that there are\\nat least five or six other kinds of whales, some of which do not\\npenetrate south of the pack, while others cruise in large numbers right\\nup to the edge of the fast ice. They feed upon the minute surface life of\\nthese seas, and large numbers of them were seen not only by the Terra\\nNova on her various cruises, but also by the shore parties in the waters\\nof McMurdo Sound. In both Wilson and Lillie we had skilled whale\\nobservers, and their work has gone far to elucidate the still obscure\\nquestions of whale distribution in the South.\\nThe pack-ice offers excellent opportunities for the identification of\\nwhales, because their movements are more restricted than in the open\\nocean. In order to identify, the observer generally has only the blow,\\nand then the shape of the back and fin as the whale goes down, to guide\\nhim. In the pack he sometimes gets more, as in the case of Balaenoptera\\nacutorostrata (Piked whale) on March 3, 1911. The ship \\"was ploughing her\\nway through thick pack-ice, in which the water was freezing between the\\nfloes, so that the only open spaces for miles around were those made by\\nthe slow movement of the ship. We saw several of these whales during the\\nday, making use of the holes in the ice near the ship for the purpose of\\nblowing. There was scarcely room between the floes for the whales to come\\nup to blow in their usual manner, which consists in rising almost\\nhorizontally, and breaking the surface of the water with their backs. On\\nthis occasion they pushed their snouts obliquely out of the water, nearly\\nas far as the eye, and after blowing, withdrew them below the water\\nagain. Commander Pennell noted that several times one rested its head on\\na floe not twenty feet from the ship, with its nostrils just on the\\nwater-line; raising itself a few inches, it would blow and then subside\\nagain for a few minutes to its original position with its snout resting\\non the floe. They took no notice of pieces of coal which were thrown at\\nthem by the men on board the ship.\\"[69]\\nBut no whale which we saw in the pack, and we often saw it elsewhere\\nalso, was so imposing as the great Blue whale, some of which were\\npossibly more than 100 feet long. \\"We used to watch this huge whale come\\nto the surface again and again to blow, at intervals of thirty to forty\\nseconds, and from the fact that at each of four or five appearances no\\nvestige of a dorsal fin was visible, we began to wonder whether we had\\nnot found the Right whale that was once reported to be so abundant in\\nRoss Sea. Again and again the spout went up into the cold air, a white\\ntwelve-foot column of condensed moisture, followed by a smooth broad\\nback, and yet no fin. For some time we remained uncertain as to its\\nidentity, till at last in sounding for a longer disappearance and a\\ngreater depth than usual, the hinder third of the enormous beast appeared\\nabove the surface for the first time with its little angular dorsal fin,\\nat once dispelling any doubts we might have had.\\"[70]\\nIt is supposed to be the largest mammal that has ever existed.[71] As it\\ncomes up to blow, \\"one sees first a small dark hump appear and then\\nimmediately a jet of grey fog squirted upwards fifteen to eighteen feet,\\ngradually spreading as it rises vertically into the frosty air. I have\\nbeen nearly in these blows once or twice and had the moisture in my face\\nwith a sickening smell of shrimpy oil. Then the hump elongates and up\\nrolls an immense blue-grey or blackish-grey round back with a faint ridge\\nalong the top, on which presently appears a small hook-like dorsal fin,\\nand then the whole sinks and disappears.\\"[72]\\nTo the biologist the pack is of absorbing interest. If you want to see\\nlife, naked and unashamed, study the struggles of this ice-world, from\\nthe diatom in the ice-floe to the big killer whale; each stage essential\\nto the life of the stage above, and living on the stage below:\\n                  THE PROTOPLASMIC CYCLE\\n    Big floes have little floes all around about \'em,\\n      And all the yellow diatoms[73] couldn\'t do without \'em.\\n    Forty million shrimplets feed upon the latter,\\n      And _they_ make the penguin and the seals and whales\\n                                                            Much fatter.\\n    Along comes the Orca[74] and kills these down below,\\n      While up above the Afterguard[75] attack them on the floe:\\n    And if a sailor tumbles in and stoves the mushy pack in,\\n      He\'s crumpled up between the floes, and so they get\\n                                                     _Their_ whack in.\\n    Then there\'s no doubt he soon becomes a Patent Fertilizer,\\n      Invigorating diatoms, although they\'re none the wiser,\\n    So the protoplasm passes on its never-ceasing round,\\n      Like a huge recurring decimal ... to which no\\n                                                   End is found.[76]\\nWe were early on the scene compared with previous expeditions, but I do\\nnot suppose this alone can explain the extremely heavy ice conditions we\\nmet. Possibly we were too far east. Our progress was very slow, and often\\nwe were hung up for days at a time, motionless and immovable, the pack\\nall close about us. Patience and always more patience! \\"From the masthead\\none can see a few patches of open water in different directions, but the\\nmain outlook is the same scene of desolate hummocky pack.\\"[77] And again:\\n\\"We have scarcely moved all day, but bergs which have become quite old\\nfriends are on the move, and one has approached and almost circled\\nus.\\"[78]\\nAnd then without warning and reason, as far as we could see, it would\\nopen out again, and broad black leads and lakes would appear where there\\nhad been only white snow and ice before, and we would make just a few\\nmore miles, and sometimes we would raise steam only to suffer further\\ndisappointment. Generally speaking, a dark black sky means open water,\\nand this is known as an open-water sky; high lights in the sky mean ice,\\nand this is known as ice-blink.\\nThe changes were as sudden as they were unexpected. Thus early in the\\nmorning of Christmas Eve, about a fortnight after we had entered the\\npack, \\"we have come into a region of where the open water exceeds the\\nice; the former lies in great irregular pools three or four miles or more\\nacross and connecting with many leads. The latter--and the fact is\\npuzzling--still contain floes of enormous dimensions; we have just passed\\none which is at least two miles in diameter....\\" And then, \\"Alas! alas!\\nat 7 A.M. this morning we were brought up with a solid sheet of pack\\nextending in all directions, save that from which we had come.\\"[79]\\nDelay was always irksome to Scott. As time went on this waiting in the\\npack became almost intolerable. He began to think we might have to winter\\nin the pack. And all the time our scanty supply of coal was being eaten\\nup, until it was said that Campbell\'s party would never be taken to King\\nEdward VII.\'s Land. Scott found decisions to bank fires, to raise steam\\nor to let fires out, most difficult at this time. \\"If one lets fires out\\nit means a dead loss of over two tons, when the boiler has to be heated\\nagain. But this two tons would only cover a day under banked fires, so\\nthat for anything longer than twenty-four hours it is economy to put the\\nfires out. At each stoppage one is called upon to decide whether it is to\\nbe for more or less than twenty-four hours.\\"[80] Certainly England should\\nhave an oil-driven ship for polar work.\\nThe Terra Nova proved a wonderfully fine ice ship. Bowers\' middle watch\\nespecially became famous for the way in which he put the ship at the ice,\\nand more than once Scott was alarmed by the great shock and collisions\\nwhich were the result: I have seen him hurry up from his cabin to put a\\nstop to it! But Bowers never hurt the ship, and she gallantly responded\\nto the calls made upon her. Sometimes it was a matter of forcing two\\nfloes apart, at others of charging and breaking one. Often we went again\\nand again at some stubborn bit, backing and charging alternately, as well\\nas the space behind us would allow. If sufficient momentum was gained the\\nship rode upon the thicker floes, rising up upon it and pressing it down\\nbeneath her, until suddenly, perhaps when its nearest edge was almost\\namidships, the weight became too great and the ice split beneath us. At\\nother times a tiny crack, no larger than a vein, would run shivering from\\nour bows, which widened and widened until the whole ship passed through\\nwithout difficulty. Always when below one heard the grumbling of the ice\\nas it passed along the side. But it was slow work, and hard on the\\nengines. There were days when we never moved at all.","image":"C03.06.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.07","output":"1.

Exasperating as it is to see the tons of coal\\nmelting away with the smallest mileage to our credit, one has at least\\nthe satisfaction of active fighting and the hope of better fortune. To\\nwait idly is the worst of conditions. You can imagine how often and how\\nrestlessly we climbed to the crow\'s nest and studied the outlook. And\\nstrangely enough there was generally some change to note. A water lead\\nwould mysteriously open up a few miles away, or the place where it had\\nbeen would as mysteriously close. Huge icebergs crept silently towards or\\npast us, and continually we were observing these formidable objects with\\nrange finder and compass to determine the relative movement, sometimes\\nwith misgivings as to our ability to clear them. Under steam the change\\nof conditions was even more marked. Sometimes we would enter a lead of\\nopen water and proceed for a mile or two without hindrance; sometimes we\\nwould come to big sheets of thin ice which broke easily as our iron-shod\\nprow struck them, and sometimes even a thin sheet would resist all our\\nattempts to break it; sometimes we would push big floes with comparative\\nease and sometimes a small floe would bar our passage with such obstinacy\\nthat one would almost believe it possessed of an evil spirit; sometimes\\nwe passed through acres of sludgy sodden ice which hissed as it swept\\nalong the side, and sometimes the hissing ceased seemingly without rhyme\\nor reason, and we found our screw churning the sea without any effect.\\n\\"Thus the steaming days passed away in an ever-changing environment and\\nare remembered as an unceasing struggle.\\n\\"The ship behaved splendidly--no other ship, not even the Discovery,\\nwould have come through so well. Certainly the Nimrod would never have\\nreached the south water had she been caught in such pack. As a result I\\nhave grown strangely attached to the Terra Nova. As she bumped the floes\\nwith mighty shocks, crushing and grinding a way through some, twisting\\nand turning to avoid others, she seemed like a living thing fighting a\\ngreat fight. If only she had more economical engines she would be\\nsuitable in all respects.\\n[Illustration: TERRA NOVA]\\n\\"Once or twice we got among floes which stood 7 or 8 feet above water,\\nwith hummocks and pinnacles as high as 25 feet. The ship could have stood\\nno chance had such floes pressed against her, and at first we were a\\nlittle alarmed in such situations. But familiarity breeds contempt;\\nthere never was any pressure in the heavy ice, and I\'m inclined to think\\nthere never would be.\\n\\"The weather changed frequently during our journey through the pack. The\\nwind blew strong from the west and from the east; the sky was often\\ndarkly overcast; we had snowstorms, flaky snow, and even light rain. In\\nall such circumstances we were better placed in the pack than outside of\\nit. The foulest weather could do us little harm. During quite a large\\npercentage of days, however, we had bright sunshine, which, even with the\\ntemperature well below freezing, made everything look bright and\\ncheerful. The sun also brought us wonderful cloud effects, marvellously\\ndelicate tints of sky, cloud and ice, such effects as one might travel\\nfar to see. In spite of our impatience we would not willingly have missed\\nmany of the beautiful scenes which our sojourn in the pack afforded us.\\nPonting and Wilson have been busy catching these effects, but no art can\\nreproduce such colours as the deep blue of the icebergs.\\"[81]\\nAs a rule the officer of the watch conned from the crow\'s nest, shouting\\nhis orders to the steersman direct, and to the engine-room through the\\nmidshipman of the watch, who stood upon the bridge. It is thrilling work\\nto the officer in charge, who not only has to face the immediate problem\\nof what floes he dare and what he dare not charge, but also to puzzle out\\nthe best course for the future,--but I expect he soon gets sick of it.\\nAbout this time Bowers made a fancy sketch of the Terra Nova hitting an\\nenormous piece of ice. The masts are all whipped forward, and from the\\ncrow\'s nest is shot first the officer of the watch, followed by cigarette\\nends and empty cocoa mugs, and lastly the hay with which the floor was\\ncovered. Upon the forecastle stands Farmer Hayseed (Oates) chewing a\\nstraw with the greatest composure, and waiting until the hay shall fall\\nat his feet, at which time he will feed it to his ponies. This crow\'s\\nnest, which was a barrel lashed to the top of the mainmast, to which\\nentrance was gained by a hinged trap-door, shielded the occupant from\\nmost of the wind. I am not sure that the steersman did not have the most\\nuninviting job, but hot cocoa is a most comforting drink and there was\\nalways plenty to be had.\\nRennick was busy sounding. The depths varied from 1804 to at least 3890\\nfathoms, and the bottom generally showed volcanic deposits. Our line of\\nsoundings showed the transition from the ocean depths to the continental\\nshelf. A series of temperatures was gained by Nelson by means of\\nreversible thermometers down to 3891 metres.\\nThe winch upon which the sounding line was wound was worked by hand on\\nthis cruise. It was worked mechanically afterwards, and of course this\\nought always to be done if possible. Just now it was a wearisome\\nbusiness, especially when we lowered a water-sample bottle one day to\\n1800 metres, spent hours in winding it up and found it still open when it\\narrived at the surface! Water samples were also obtained at the various\\ndepths. Lillie and Nelson were both busy tow-netting for plankton with\\nfull-speed, Apstein, Nansen, 24-and 180-mesh nets.\\nI don\'t think many at home had a more pleasant Christmas Day than we. It\\nwas beautifully calm with the pack all round. At 10 we had church with\\nlots of Christmas hymns, and then decorated the ward-room with all our\\nsledging flags. These flags are carried by officers on Arctic\\nexpeditions, and are formed of the St. George\'s Cross with a continuation\\nending in a swallow-tail in the heraldic colours to which the individual\\nis entitled, and upon this is embroidered his crest. The men forrard had\\ntheir Christmas dinner of fresh mutton at mid-day; there was plenty of\\npenguin for them, but curiously enough they did not think it good enough\\nfor a Christmas dinner. The ward-room ate penguin in the evening, and\\nafter the toast of \'absent friends\' we began to sing, and twice round the\\ntable everybody had to contribute a song. Ponting\'s banjo songs were a\\ngreat success, also Oates\'s \'The Vly on the tu-urmuts.\' Meares sang \\"a\\nlittle song about our Expedition, and many of the members that Southward\\nwould go,\\" of his own composition. The general result was that the\\nwatches were all over the place that night. At 4 A.M. Day whispered in\\nmy ear that there was nothing to do, and Pennell promised to call me if\\nthere was--so I remembered no more until past six.\\nAnd Crean\'s rabbit gave birth to seventeen little ones, and it was said\\nthat Crean had already given away twenty-two.\\nWe had stopped and banked fires against an immense composite floe on the\\nevening of Christmas Eve. How we watched the little changes in the ice\\nand the wind, and scanned the horizon for those black patches which meant\\nopen water ahead. But always there was that same white sky to the south\\nof us. And then one day there came the shadow of movement on the sea, the\\nfaintest crush on the brash ice, the whisper of great disturbances afar\\noff. It settled again: our hopes were dashed to the ground. Then came the\\nwind. It was so thick that we could not see far; but even in our\\nrestricted field changes were in progress.\\n\\"We commence to move between two floes, make 200 or 300 yards, and are\\nthen brought up bows on to a large lump. This may mean a wait of anything\\nfrom ten minutes to half-an-hour, whilst the ship swings round, falls\\naway, and drifts to leeward. When clear she forges ahead again and the\\noperation is repeated. Occasionally when she can get a little way on she\\ncracks the obstacle and slowly passes through it. There is a distinct\\nswell--very long, very low. I counted the period as about nine seconds.\\nEvery one says the ice is breaking up.\\"[82]\\nOn December 28 the gale abated. The sky cleared, and showed signs of open\\nwater ahead. It was cold in the wind but the sun was wonderful, and we\\nlay out on deck and basked in its warmth, a cheerful, careless crowd.\\nAfter breakfast there was a consultation between Scott and Wilson in the\\ncrow\'s nest. It was decided to raise steam.\\nMeanwhile we sounded, and found a volcanic muddy bottom at 2035 fathoms.\\nThe last sounding showed 1400 fathoms; we had passed over a bank.\\nSteam came at 8 P.M. and we began to push forward. At first it was hard\\ngoing, but slowly we elbowed our way until the spaces of open water\\nbecame more frequent. Soon we found one or two large pools, several miles\\nin extent; then the floes became smaller. Later we could see no really\\nbig floes at all; \\"the sheets of thin ice are broken into comparatively\\nregular figures, none more than thirty yards across,\\" and \\"we are\\nsteaming amongst floes of small area evidently broken by swell, and with\\nedges abraded by contact.\\"[83]\\nWe could not be far from the southern edge of the pack. Twenty-four hours\\nafter raising steam we were still making good progress, checking\\nsometimes to carve our way through some obstacle. At last we were getting\\na return for the precious coal expended. The sky was overcast, the\\noutlook from the masthead flat and dreary, but hour by hour it became\\nmore obvious that we neared the threshold of the open sea. At 1 A.M. on\\nFriday, December 30 (lat. about 71\xbd\xb0 S., noon observation 72\xb0 17\xb4 S.,\\n177\xb0 9\xb4 E.) Bowers steered through the last ice stream. Behind was some\\n400 miles of ice. Cape Crozier was 334 miles (geog.) ahead.\\nFOOTNOTES:","image":"C03.07.jpeg"},{"merge":"C03.08","output":"Sorry, there is no passage from The Worst Journey in the World included in the input or the passage has been cut off.

Within a\\nfew hours I was sick, _very_ sick; but we newcomers to the Antarctic had\\nyet to learn that we knew nothing about its barometer. Nothing very\\nterrible happened after all. When I got up to the bridge for the morning\\nwatch we were in open water and it was blowing fresh. It freshened all\\nday, and by the evening it was blowing a southerly with a short choppy\\nNorth Sea swell, and very warm. By 4 A.M. the next morning there was a\\nbig sea running and the dogs and ponies were having a bad time. Rennick\\nhad the morning watch these days, and I was his humble midshipman.\\nAt 5.45 we sighted what we thought was a berg on the port bow. About\\nthree minutes later Rennick said, \\"There\'s a bit of pack,\\" and I went\\nbelow and reported to Evans. It was very thick with driving snow and also\\nfoggy, and before Evans got up to the bridge we were quite near the pack,\\nand amongst bits which had floated from it, one of which must have been\\nour berg. We took in the headsails as quickly as possible, these being\\nthe only sails set, and nosed along dead slow to leeward under steam\\nalone. Gradually we could see either pack or the blink of it all along\\nour port and starboard beam, while gradually we felt our way down a big\\npatch of open water.\\nThere was quite a meeting on the bridge, and it was decided to get well\\nin, and lie in open water under lee of the pack till the gale blew itself\\nout. \\"Under ordinary circumstances the safe course would have been to go\\nabout and stand to the east. But in our case we must risk trouble to get\\nsmoother water for the ponies. We passed a stream of ice over which the\\nsea was breaking heavily, and one realized the danger of being amongst\\nloose floes in such a sea. But soon we came to a compacter body of floes,\\nand running behind this we were agreeably surprised to find comparatively\\nsmooth water. We ran on for a bit, then stopped and lay to.\\"[84]\\nAll that day we lay behind that pack, steaming slowly to leeward every\\nnow and then, as the ice drifted down upon us. Towards night it began to\\nclear. It was New Year\'s Eve.\\nI turned in, thinking to wake in 1911. But I had not been long asleep\\nwhen I found Atkinson at my side. \\"Have you seen the land?\\" he said.\\n\\"Wrap your blankets round you, and go and see.\\" And when I got up on deck\\nI could see nothing for a while. Then he said: \\"All the high lights are\\nsnow lit up by the sun.\\" And there they were: the most glorious peaks\\nappearing, as it were like satin, above the clouds, the only white in a\\ndark horizon. The first glimpse of Antarctic land, Sabine and the great\\nmountains of the Admiralty Range. They were 110 miles away. But\\n          Icy mountains high on mountains pil\'d\\n    Seem to the shivering sailor from afar\\n    Shapeless and white, an atmosphere of cloud;[85]\\nand, truth to tell, I went back to my warm bunk. At midnight a rowdy mob,\\nringing the New Year in with the dinner-bell, burst into our Nursery. I\\nexpected to be hauled out, but got off with a dig in the ribs from\\nBirdie Bowers.\\nIn brilliant sunshine we coasted down Victoria Land. \\"To-night it is\\nabsolutely calm, with glorious bright sunshine. Several people were\\nsunning themselves at 11 o\'clock! Sitting on deck and reading.\\"[86]\\nAt 8.30 on Monday night, January 2, we sighted Erebus, 115 miles away.\\nThe next morning most of us were on the yards furling sail. We were\\nheading for Cape Crozier, the northern face of Ross Island was open to\\nour fascinated gaze, and away to the east stretched the Barrier face\\nuntil it disappeared below the horizon. Ad\xe9lie penguins and Killer whales\\nwere abundant in the water through which we steamed.\\nI have seen Fuji, the most dainty and graceful of all mountains; and also\\nKinchinjunga: only Michael Angelo among men could have conceived such\\ngrandeur. But give me Erebus for my friend. Whoever made Erebus knew all\\nthe charm of horizontal lines, and the lines of Erebus are for the most\\npart nearer the horizontal than the vertical. And so he is the most\\nrestful mountain in the world, and I was glad when I knew that our hut\\nwould lie at his feet. And always there floated from his crater the lazy\\nbanner of his cloud of steam.\\nNow we had reached the Barrier face some five miles east of the point at\\nwhich it joins the basalt cliffs of Cape Crozier. We could see the great\\npressure waves which had proved such an obstacle to travellers from the\\nDiscovery to the Emperor penguin rookery. The Knoll was clear, but the\\nsummit of Mount Terror was in the clouds. As for the Barrier we seemed to\\nhave known it all our lives, it was so exactly like what we had imagined\\nit to be, and seen in the pictures and photographs.\\nScott had a whaler launched, and we pulled in under the cliffs. There was\\na considerable swell.\\n\\"We were to examine the possibilities of landing, but the swell was so\\nheavy in its break among the floating blocks of ice along the actual\\nbeach and ice foot that a landing was out of the question. We should\\nhave broken up the boat and have all been in the water together. But I\\nassure you it was tantalizing to me, for there about six feet above us on\\na small dirty piece of the old bay ice about ten feet square one living\\nEmperor penguin chick was standing disconsolately stranded, and close by\\nstood one faithful old Emperor parent asleep. This young Emperor was\\nstill in the down, a most interesting fact in the bird\'s life history at\\nwhich we had rightly guessed, but which no one had actually observed\\nbefore. It was in a stage never yet seen or collected, for the wings were\\nalready quite clean of down and feathered as in the adult, also a line\\ndown the breast was shed of down and part of the head. This bird would\\nhave been a treasure to me, but we could not risk life for it, so it had\\nto remain where it was. It was a curious fact that with as much clean ice\\nto live on as they could have wished for, these destitute derelicts of a\\nflourishing colony, now gone north to sea on floating bay ice, should\\nhave preferred to remain standing on the only piece of bay ice left, a\\npiece about ten feet square and now pressed up six feet above water\\nlevel, evidently wondering why it was so long in starting north with the\\ngeneral exodus which must have taken place just a month ago. The whole\\nincident was most interesting and full of suggestion as to the slow\\nworking of the brain of these queer people. Another point was most weird\\nto see, that on the _under_ side of this very dirty piece of sea-ice,\\nwhich was about two feet thick and which hung over the water as a sort of\\ncave, we could see the legs and lower halves of dead Emperor chicks\\nhanging through, and even in one place a dead adult. I hope to make a\\npicture of the whole quaint incident, for it was a corner crammed full of\\nImperial history in the light of what we already knew, and it would\\notherwise have been about as unintelligible as any group of animate or\\ninanimate nature could possibly have been. As it is, it throws more light\\non the life history of this strangely primitive bird....","image":"C04.01.jpeg"},{"merge":"C04.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The crew sails along Mount Terror and finds a large Ad\xe9lie penguin rookery but could not land as the coast is impassable.

It was the return of a sledge party which tried to reach\\nthis record from the Barrier that led to Vince\'s terrible death.[88] As\\nwe coasted along we could see this post quite plainly, looking as new as\\nthe day it was erected, and we know now that there is communication with\\nthe Barrier behind, while this rookery itself is free from the blizzards\\nwhich sweep out to sea by Cape Crozier. It was therefore an excellent\\nplace to winter and it was a considerable disappointment to find that it\\nwas impossible to land.\\nThis was the first sight we had of a rookery of the little Ad\xe9lie\\npenguin. Hundreds of thousands of birds dotted the shore, and there were\\nmany thousands in the sea round the ship. As we came to know these\\nrookeries better we came to look upon these quaint creatures more as\\nfamiliar friends than as casual acquaintances. Whatever a penguin does\\nhas individuality, and he lays bare his whole life for all to see. He\\ncannot fly away. And because he is quaint in all that he does, but still\\nmore because he is fighting against bigger odds than any other bird, and\\nfighting always with the most gallant pluck, he comes to be considered as\\nsomething apart from the ordinary bird--sometimes solemn, sometimes\\nhumorous, enterprising, chivalrous, cheeky--and always (unless you are\\ndriving a dog-team) a welcome and, in some ways, an almost human friend.\\nThe alternative landing-place to Cape Crozier was somewhere in McMurdo\\nSound, the essential thing being that we should have access to and from\\nthe Barrier, such communication having to be by sea-ice, since the land\\nis for the most part impassable. As we steamed from Cape Crozier to Cape\\nBird, the N.W. extremity of Ross Island, we carried out a detailed\\nrunning survey.\\nWhen we neared Cape Bird and Beaufort Island we could see that there was\\nmuch pack in the mouth of the Strait. By keeping close in to the land we\\navoided the worst of the trouble, and \\"as we rounded Cape Bird we came in\\nsight of the old well-remembered landmarks--Mount Discovery and the\\nWestern Mountains--seen dimly through a hazy atmosphere. It was good to\\nsee them again, and perhaps after all we are better this side of the\\nIsland. It gives one a homely feeling to see such a familiar scene.\\"[89]\\nRight round from Cape Crozier to Cape Royds the coast is cold and\\nforbidding, and for the most part heavily crevassed. West of Cape Bird\\nare some small penguin rookeries, and high up on the ice slopes could be\\nseen some grey granite boulders. These are erratics, brought by ice from\\nthe Western Mountains, and are evidence of a warmer past when the Barrier\\nrose some two thousand feet higher than it does now, and stretched many\\nhundreds of miles farther out to sea. But now the Antarctic is becoming\\ncolder, the deposition of snow is therefore farther north, and the\\nformation of ice correspondingly less.\\n[Illustration: SOUNDING--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\n[Illustration: KRISRAVITZA]\\nMany watched all night, as this new world unfolded itself, cape by cape\\nand mountain by mountain. We pushed through some heavy floes and \\"at 6\\nA.M. (on January 4) we came through the last of the Strait pack some\\nthree miles north of Cape Royds. We steered for the Cape, fully expecting\\nto find the edge of the pack-ice ranging westward from it. To our\\nastonishment we ran on past the Cape with clear water or thin sludge ice\\non all sides of us. Past Cape Royds, past Cape Barne, past the glacier on\\nits south side, and finally round and past Inaccessible Island, a good\\ntwo miles south of Cape Royds. The Cape itself was cut off from the\\nsouth. We could have gone farther, but the last sludge ice seemed to be\\nincreasing in thickness, and there was no wintering spot to aim for but\\nCape Armitage.[90] I have never seen the ice of the Sound in such a\\ncondition or the land so free from snow. Taking these facts in\\nconjunction with the exceptional warmth of the air, I came to the\\nconclusion that it had been an exceptionally warm summer. At this point\\nit was evident that we had a considerable choice of wintering spots. We\\ncould have gone to either of the small islands, to the mainland, the\\nGlacier Tongue, or pretty well anywhere except Hut Point. My main wish\\nwas to choose a place that would not be easily cut off from the Barrier,\\nand my eye fell on a cape which we used to call the Skuary, a little\\nbehind us. It was separated from the old Discovery quarters by two deep\\nbays on either side of the Glacier Tongue, and I thought that these bays\\nwould remain frozen until late in the season, and that when they froze\\nover again the ice would soon become firm. I called a council and put\\nthese propositions. To push on to the Glacier Tongue and winter there; to\\npush west to the \'tombstone\' ice and to make our way to an inviting spot\\nto the northward of the cape we used to call \'the Skuary.\' I favoured the\\nlatter course, and on discussion we found it obviously the best, so we\\nturned back close around Inaccessible Island and steered for the fast ice\\noff the Cape at full speed. After piercing a small fringe of thin ice at\\nthe edge of the fast floe the ship\'s stem struck heavily on hard bay ice\\nabout a mile and a half from the shore. Here was a road to the Cape and a\\nsolid wharf on which to land our stores. We made fast with\\nice-anchors.\\"[91]\\nScott, Wilson and Evans walked away over the sea-ice, but were soon back.\\nThey reported an excellent site for a hut on a shelving beach on the\\nnorthern side of the Cape before us, which was henceforward called Cape\\nEvans, after our second in command. Landing was to begin forthwith.\\nFirst came the two big motor sledges which took up so much of our deck\\nspace. In spite of the hundreds of tons of sea-water which had washed\\nover and about them they came out of their big crates looking \\"as fresh\\nand clean as if they had been packed on the previous day.\\"[92] They were\\nrunning that same afternoon.\\nWe had a horse-box for the ponies, which came next, but it wanted all\\nOates\' skill and persuasion to get them into it. All seventeen of them\\nwere soon on the floe, rolling and kicking with joy, and thence they were\\nled across to the beach where they were carefully picketed to a rope run\\nover a snow slope where they could not eat sand. Shackleton lost four out\\nof eight ponies within a month of his arrival. His ponies were picketed\\non rubbly ground at Cape Royds, and ate the sand for the salt flavour it\\npossessed. The fourth pony died from eating shavings in which chemicals\\nhad been packed. This does not mean that they were hungry, merely that\\nthese Manchurian ponies eat the first thing that comes in their way,\\nwhether it be a bit of sugar or a bit of Erebus.\\nMeanwhile the dog-teams were running light loads between the ship and the\\nshore. \\"The great trouble with them has been due to the fatuous conduct\\nof the penguins. Groups of these have been constantly leaping on to our\\nfloe. From the moment of landing on their feet their whole attitude\\nexpressed devouring curiosity and a pig-headed disregard for their own\\nsafety. They waddle forward, poking their heads to and fro in their\\nusually absurd way, in spite of a string of howling dogs straining to get\\nat them. \'Hulloa!\' they seem to say, \'here\'s a game--what do all you\\nridiculous things want?\' And they come a few steps nearer. The dogs make\\na rush as far as their harness or leashes allow. The penguins are not\\ndaunted in the least, but their ruffs go up and they squawk with\\nsemblance of anger, for all the world as though they were rebutting a\\nrude stranger--their attitude might be imagined to convey, \'Oh, that\'s\\nthe sort of animal you are; well, you\'ve come to the wrong place--we\\naren\'t going to be bluffed and bounced by you,\' and then the final fatal\\nsteps forward are taken and they come within reach. There is a spring, a\\nsquawk, a horrid red patch on the snow, and the incident is closed.\\"[93]","image":"C04.02.jpeg"},{"merge":"C04.03","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The landing of stores on the ice is completed with the help of pony and motor teams and despite some difficulties, everything is transported successfully.

Petrol, paraffin, pony food, dog food, sledges and sledging\\ngear, hut furniture, provisions of all kinds both for life at the hut and\\nfor sledging, coal, scientific instruments and gear, carbide, medical\\nstores, clothing--I do not know how many times we sledged over that\\nsea-ice, but I do know that we were landed as regards all essentials in\\nsix days. \\"Nothing like it has been done before; nothing so expeditious\\nand complete.\\"[95] ... and \\"Words cannot express the splendid way in\\nwhich every one works.\\"[96]\\nThe two motors, the two dog-teams, man-hauling parties, and, as they were\\npassed for work by Oates, the ponies; all took part in this transport. As\\nusual Bowers knew just where everything was, and where it was to go, and\\nhe was most ably seconded on the ship by Rennick and Bruce. Both\\nman-hauling parties and pony-leaders commonly did ten journeys a day, a\\ndistance of over thirty miles. The ponies themselves did one to three or\\nfour journeys as they were considered fit.\\nGenerally speaking the transport seemed satisfactory, but it soon became\\nclear that sea-ice was very hard on the motor sledge runners. \\"The motor\\nsledges are working well, but not very well; the small difficulties will\\nbe got over, but I rather fear they will never draw the loads we expect\\nof them. Still they promise to be a help, and they are a lively and\\nattractive feature of our present scene as they drone along over the\\nfloe. At a little distance, without silencers, they sound exactly like\\nthreshing machines.\\"[97]\\nThe ponies were the real problem. It was to be expected that they would\\nbe helpless and exhausted after their long and trying voyage. Not a bit\\nof it! They were soon rolling about, biting one another, kicking one\\nanother, and any one else, with the best will in the world. After two\\ndays\' rest on shore, twelve of them were thought fit to do one journey,\\non which they pulled loads varying from 700 to 1000 lbs. with ease on the\\nhard sea-ice surface. But it was soon clear that these ponies were an\\nuneven lot. There were the steady workers like Punch and Nobby; there\\nwere one or two definitely weak ponies like Blossom, Bl\xfccher and Jehu;\\nand there were one or two strong but rather impossible beasts. One of\\nthese was soon known as Weary Willie. His outward appearance belied him,\\nfor he looked like a pony. A brief acquaintance soon convinced me that\\nhe was without doubt a cross between a pig and a mule. He was obviously a\\nstrong beast and, since he always went as slowly as possible and stopped\\nas often as possible it was most difficult to form any opinion as to what\\nload he was really able to draw. Consequently I am afraid there is little\\ndoubt that he was generally overloaded until that grim day on the Barrier\\nwhen he was set upon by a dog-team. It was his final collapse at the end\\nof the Dep\xf4t journey which caused Scott to stay behind when we went out\\non the sea-ice. But of that I shall speak again.\\nTwice only have I ever seen Weary Willie trot. We were leading the ponies\\nnow as always with halters and without bits. Consequently our control was\\nlimited, especially on ice, but doubtless the ponies\' comfort was\\nincreased, especially in cold weather when a metal bit would have been\\ndifficult if not impossible. On this occasion he and I had just arrived\\nat the ship after a trudge in which I seemed to be pulling both Weary and\\nthe sledge. Just then a motor back-fired, and we started back across that\\nfloe at a pace which surprised Weary even more than myself, for he fell\\nover the sledge, himself and me, and for days I felt like a big black\\nbruise. The second occasion on which he got a move on was during the\\nDep\xf4t journey when Gran on ski tried to lead him.\\nChristopher and Hackenschmidt were impossible ponies. Christopher, as we\\nshall see, died on the Barrier a year after this, fighting almost to the\\nlast. Hackenschmidt, so called \\"from his vicious habit of using both fore\\nand hind legs in attacking those who came near him,\\"[98] led an even more\\nlurid life but had a more peaceful end. Whether Oates could have tamed\\nhim I do not know: he would have done it if it were possible, for his\\nmanagement of horses was wonderful. But in any case Hackenschmidt\\nsickened at the hut while we were absent on the Dep\xf4t journey, for no\\ncause which could be ascertained, gradually became too weak to stand, and\\nwas finally put out of his misery.\\nThere was a breathless minute when Hackenschmidt, with a sledge attached\\nto him, went galloping over the hills and boulders. Below him, all\\nunconscious of his impending fate, was Ponting, adjusting a large camera\\nwith his usual accuracy. Both survived. There were runaways innumerable,\\nand all kinds of falls. But these ponies could tumble about unharmed in a\\nway which would cause an English horse to lie up for a week. \\"There is no\\ndoubt that the bumping of the sledges close at the heels of the animals\\nis the root of the evil.\\"[99]\\nThere were two adventures during this first week of landing stores which\\nmight well have had a more disastrous conclusion. The first of these was\\nthe adventure of Ponting and the Killer whales.\\n\\"I was a little late on the scene this morning, and thereby witnessed a\\nmost extraordinary scene. Some six or seven killer whales, old and young,\\nwere skirting the fast floe edge ahead of the ship; they seemed excited\\nand dived rapidly, almost touching the floe. As we watched, they suddenly\\nappeared astern, raising their snouts out of water. I had heard weird\\nstories of these beasts, but had never associated serious danger with\\nthem. Close to the water\'s edge lay the wire stern rope of the ship, and\\nour two Esquimaux dogs were tethered to this. I did not think of\\nconnecting the movement of the whales with this fact, and seeing them so\\nclose I shouted to Ponting, who was standing abreast of the ship. He\\nseized his camera and ran towards the floe edge to get a close picture of\\nthe beasts, which had momentarily disappeared. The next moment the whole\\nfloe under him and the dogs heaved up and split into fragments. One could\\nhear the booming noise as the whales rose under the ice and struck it\\nwith their backs. Whale after whale rose under the ice, setting it\\nrocking fiercely; luckily Ponting kept his feet and was able to fly to\\nsecurity. By an extraordinary chance also, the splits had been made\\naround and between the dogs, so that neither of them fell into the water.\\nThen it was clear that the whales shared our astonishment, for one after\\nanother their huge hideous heads shot vertically into the air through\\nthe cracks which they had made. As they reared them to a height of six\\nor eight feet it was possible to see their tawny head markings, their\\nsmall glistening eyes, and their terrible array of teeth--by far the\\nlargest and most terrifying in the world. There cannot be a doubt that\\nthey looked up to see what had happened to Ponting and the dogs.\\n\\"The latter were horribly frightened and strained to their chains,\\nwhining; the head of one killer must certainly have been within five feet\\nof one of the dogs.\\n\\"After this, whether they thought the game insignificant, or whether they\\nmissed Ponting is uncertain, but the terrifying creatures passed on to\\nother hunting grounds, and we were able to rescue the dogs, and what was\\neven more important, our petrol--five or six tons of which was waiting on\\na piece of ice which was not split away from the main mass.","image":"C04.03.jpeg"},{"merge":"C04.04","output":"The passage describes the dangers faced by the explorers from killer whales and ice breaking during their journey in the south pole as well as the construction of their hut and other structures. \\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"Of course, we have known well that killer whales continually skirt the edge of the floes and that they would undoubtedly snap up any one who was unfortunate enough to fall into the water; but the facts that they could display such deliberate cunning, that they were able to break ice of such thickness (at least 2\xbd feet), and that they could act in unison, were a revelation to us.\\"\\n\\nExcerpt 2: \\"The floor consisted of a wooden boarding next the frame, then a quilt of seaweed, then a layer of felt upon which was a second boarding and finally linoleum.\\"\\n\\nText to image prompt: A wooden framed hut with double boarded walls, a rubberoid roof with quilted seaweed insulation and a door leading to a porch with acetylene gas generators, with a floor made of wooden boarding, seaweed, felt and linoleum.","parsed":{"summary":"The passage describes the dangers faced by the explorers from killer whales and ice breaking during their journey in the south pole as well as the construction of their hut and other structures.","excerpt_1":"\\"Of course, we have known well that killer whales continually skirt the edge of the floes and that they would undoubtedly snap up any one who was unfortunate enough to fall into the water; but the facts that they could display such deliberate cunning, that they were able to break ice of such thickness (at least 2\xbd feet), and that they could act in unison, were a revelation to us.\\"","excerpt_2":"\\"The floor consisted of a wooden boarding next the frame, then a quilt of seaweed, then a layer of felt upon which was a second boarding and finally linoleum.\\"","text_to_image":"A wooden framed hut with double boarded walls, a rubberoid roof with quilted seaweed insulation and a door leading to a porch with acetylene gas generators, with a floor made of wooden boarding, seaweed, felt and linoleum."},"passage":"\\"Of course, we have known well that killer whales continually skirt the\\nedge of the floes and that they would undoubtedly snap up any one who was\\nunfortunate enough to fall into the water; but the facts that they could\\ndisplay such deliberate cunning, that they were able to break ice of such\\nthickness (at least 2\xbd feet), and that they could act in unison, were a\\nrevelation to us.

It was\\nSunday morning, January 8, and Scott had given orders that this motor was\\nto be hoisted out of the ship. \\"This was done first thing and the motor\\nplaced on firm ice. Later Campbell told me one of the men had dropped a\\nleg through crossing a sludgy patch some 200 yards from the ship. I\\ndidn\'t consider it very serious, as I imagined the man had only gone\\nthrough the surface crust. About 7 A.M. I started for the shore with a\\nsingle man load, leaving Campbell looking about for the best crossing for\\nthe motor.\\"[101]\\nI find a note in my own diary as to what happened after that: \\"Last night\\nthe ice was getting very soft in places, and I was a little doubtful\\nabout leading ponies over a spot on the route to the hut which is about a\\nquarter of a mile from the ship. It has been thawing very fast the last\\nfew days, and has been very hot as Antarctic weather goes. This morning\\nwas the same, and Bailey went in up to his neck.\\n\\"Some half-hour after the motor was put on to the floe, we were told to\\ntow it on to firm ice as that near the ship was breaking up. All hands\\nstarted on a long tow line. We got on to the rotten piece, and somebody\\nbehind shouted \'You must run.\' From that moment everything happened very\\nquickly. Williamson fell right in through the ice; immediately afterwards\\nwe were all brought up with a jerk. Then the line began to pull us\\nbackwards; the stern of the motor had sunk through the ice, and the whole\\ncar began to sink. It slowly went right through and disappeared and then\\nthe tow line followed it. Everything possible was done to hang on to the\\nrope, but in the end we had to let it go, each man keeping his hold until\\nhe was dragged to the lip of the hole. Then we made for the fast ice,\\nleaving the rotten bit between us and the ship.\\n\\"Pennell and Priestley sounded their way back to the ship, and Day asked\\nPriestley to bring his goggles when he returned. They came back with a\\nlife-line, Pennell leading. Suddenly the ice gave way under Priestley,\\nwho disappeared entirely and came up, so we learned afterwards, under the\\nice, there being a big current. In a moment Pennell was lying flat upon\\nthe floe on his chest, got his hand under Priestley\'s arm, and so pulled\\nhim out. All Priestley said was, \'Day, here are your goggles.\' We all got\\nback to the ship, but communication between the ship and the shore was\\ninterrupted for the rest of the day, when a solid road was found right up\\nto the ship in another place.\\"[102]\\nMeanwhile the hut was rising very quickly, and Davies, who was Chippy\\nChap, the carpenter, deserves much credit. He was a leading shipwright\\nin the navy, always willing and bright, and with a very thorough\\nknowledge of his job. I have seen him called up hour after hour, day and\\nnight, on the ship, when the pumps were choked by the coal balls which\\nformed in the bilges, and he always arrived with a smile on his face.\\nAltogether he was one of our most useful men. In this job of hut-building\\nhe was helped by two of our seamen, Keohane and Abbott, and others.\\nLatterly I believe there were more people working than there were\\nhammers!\\nA plan of this hut is given here. It was 50 feet long, by 25 feet wide,\\nand 9 feet to the eaves. The insulation, which was very satisfactory, was\\nseaweed, sewn up in the form of a quilt.\\n\\"The sides have double [match-] boarding inside and outside the frames,\\nwith a layer of our excellent quilted seaweed insulation between each\\npair of boardings. The roof has a single match-boarding inside, but on\\nthe outside is a match-boarding, then a layer of 2-ply ruberoid, then a\\nlayer of quilted seaweed, then a second match-boarding, and finally a\\ncover of 3-ply ruberoid.\\"[103]\\nThe floor consisted of a wooden boarding next the frame, then a quilt of\\nseaweed, then a layer of felt upon which was a second boarding and\\nfinally linoleum.\\nWe thought we should be warm, and we were. In fact, during the winter,\\nwith twenty-five men living there, and the cooking range going, and\\nperhaps also the stove at the other end, the hut not infrequently became\\nfuggy, big though it was.\\nThe entrance was through a door in a porch before you got to the main\\ndoor. In the porch were the generators of the acetylene gas, which was\\nfitted throughout by Day, who was also responsible for the fittings of\\nthe ventilator, cooking range, and stove, the chimney pipes from these\\nrunning along through the middle of the hut before entering a common\\nvent. Little heat was lost. The pipes were fitted with dampers, and air\\ninlets which could be opened or shut at will to control the ventilation.\\nBesides a big ventilator in the top of the hut there was an adjustable\\nair inlet also at the base of the chamber which formed the junction of\\nthe two chimneys. The purpose of this was also ventilation, but it was\\nnot successful.\\nThe bulkhead which separated the men\'s quarters, or mess deck, from the\\nrest of the hut, was formed of such cases as contained goods in glass,\\nincluding wine, which would have frozen and broken outside. The bulkhead\\ndid not go as high as the top of the hut. When the contents of a case\\nwere wanted, a side of the box was taken out, and the empty case then\\nformed a shelf.\\nWe started to live in the hut on January 18, beautifully warm, the\\ngramophone going, and everybody happy. But for a long time before this\\nmost of the landing party had been living in tents on shore. It was very\\ncomfortable, far more so than might be supposed, judging only by the\\npopular idea of a polar life. We were now almost landed, there were just\\na few things more to come over from the ship. \\"It was blowing a mild\\nblizzard from the south, and I took a sledge over to the ship, which was\\nquite blotted out in blinding snow at times. It was as hard to get an\\nempty sledge over, as generally it is to drag a full one. Tea on the\\nship, which was very full of welcome, but also very full of the\\nsuperiority of their own comforts over those of the land. Their own\\ncomforts were not so very obvious, since they had tried to get the stove\\nin the wardroom going for the first time. They were all coughing in the\\nsmoke, and everything inside was covered with smuts.\\"[104]\\nThe hut itself was some twelve feet above the sea, and situated upon what\\nwas now an almost sandy beach of black lava. It was thought that this was\\nhigh enough to be protected from any swell likely to arrive in such a\\nsheltered place, but, as we shall see, Scott was very anxious as to the\\nfate of the hut, when, on the Dep\xf4t journey, a swell removed not only\\nmiles of sea-ice and a good deal of Barrier, but also the end of Glacier\\nTongue. We never saw this beach again, for the autumn gales covered it\\nwith thick drifts of snow, and the thaw was never enough to remove this\\nfor the two other summers we spent here. There is no doubt this was an\\nexceptional year for thaw. We never again saw a little waterfall such as\\nwas now tumbling down the rocks from Skua Lake into the sea.\\nThe little hill of 66 feet high behind us was soon named Wind Vane Hill,\\nand there were other meteorological instruments there besides. A\\nsnow-drift or ice-drift always forms to leeward of any such projection,\\nand that beneath this hill was large enough for us to drive into it two\\nice caves. The first of these was to contain our larder, notably the\\nfrozen mutton carcasses brought down by us from New Zealand in the\\nice-house on deck. These, however, showed signs of mildew, and we never\\nate very freely of them. Seal and penguin were our stock meat foods, and\\nmutton was considered to be a luxury.\\nThe second cave, 13 feet long by 5 feet wide, hollowed out by Simpson and\\nWright, was for the magnetic instruments. The temperature of these caves\\nwas found to be fairly constant. Unfortunately, this was the only drift\\ninto which we could tunnel, and we had no such mass of snow and ice as is\\nafforded by the Barrier, which can be burrowed, and was burrowed\\nextensively by Amundsen and his men.","image":"C04.04.jpeg"},{"merge":"C04.05","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the arrangement of supplies and animals at the Cape Evans camp during the expedition to the south pole.

The sledges lay on the hill side\\nabove them. This arrangement was very satisfactory during the first\\nwinter, but the excessive blizzards of the second winter and the immense\\namount of snow which was gathering about the camp caused us to move\\neverything up to the top of the ridge behind the hut where the wind kept\\nthem more clear. Amundsen found it advisable to put his cases in two long\\nlines.[105]\\nThe dogs were tethered to a long chain or rope. The ponies\' stable was\\nbuilt against the northern side of the hut, and was thus sheltered from\\nthe blizzards which always blow here from the south.

Cape Evans is one of the many spurs of Erebus and the one that\\nstands closest under the mountain, so that always towering above us we\\nhave the grand snowy peak with its smoking summit. North and south of us\\nare deep bays, beyond which great glaciers come rippling over the lower\\nslopes to thrust high blue-walled snouts into the sea. The sea is blue\\nbefore us, dotted with shining bergs or ice floes, whilst far over the\\nSound, yet so bold and magnificent as to appear near, stand the beautiful\\nWestern Mountains with their numerous lofty peaks, their deep glacial\\nvalley and clear cut scarps, a vision of mountain scenery that can have\\nfew rivals.\\"[107]\\n[Illustration: MT. EREBUS, THE RAMP AND THE HUT]\\n\\"Before I left England people were always telling me the Antarctic must\\nbe dull without much life. Now we are in ourselves a perfect farmyard.\\nThere are nineteen ponies fifty yards off and thirty dogs just behind,\\nand they howl like the wolves they are at intervals, led by Dyk. The\\nskuas are nesting all round and fighting over the remains of the seals\\nwhich we have killed, and the penguins which the dogs have killed,\\nwhenever they have got the chance. The collie bitch which we have\\nbrought down for breeding purposes wanders about the camp. A penguin is\\nstanding outside my tent, presumably because he thinks he is going to\\nmoult here. A seal has just walked up into the horse lines--there are\\nplenty of Weddell and penguins and whales. On board we have Nigger and a\\nblue Persian kitten, with rabbits and squirrels. The whole place teems\\nwith life.\\n\\"Franky Drake is employed all day wandering round for ice for watering\\nthe ship. Yesterday he had made a pile out on the floe, and the men\\nwanted to have a flag put on it, and have it photographed, and called\\n\'Mr. Drake\'s Furthest South.\'\\"[108]\\nJanuary 25 was fixed as the day upon which twelve of us, with eight\\nponies and the two dog-teams, were to start south to lay a dep\xf4t upon the\\nBarrier for the Polar Journey. Scott was of opinion that the bays between\\nus and the Hut Point Peninsula would freeze over in March, probably early\\nin March, and that we should most of us get back to Cape Evans then. At\\nthe same time the ponies could not come down over the cliffs of this\\ntongue of land, and preparations had to be made for a lengthy stay at Hut\\nPoint for them and their keepers. For this purpose Scott meant to use the\\nold Discovery hut at Hut Point.[109]\\nOn January 15 he took Meares and one dog-team, and started for Hut Point,\\nwhich was fifteen statute miles to the south of us. They crossed Glacier\\nTongue, finding upon it a dep\xf4t of compressed fodder and maize which had\\nbeen left by Shackleton. The open water to the west nearly reached the\\nTongue.\\nOn arrival at the hut Scott was shocked to find it full of snow and ice.\\nThis was serious, and, as we found afterwards the drifted snow had thawed\\ndown into ice: the whole of the inside of this hut was a big ice block.\\nIn the middle of this ice was a pile of cases left by the Discovery as a\\ndep\xf4t. They were, we knew, full of biscuit.\\n\\"There was something too depressing in finding the old hut in such a\\ndesolate condition. I had had so much interest in seeing all the old\\nlandmarks and the huts apparently intact. To camp outside and feel that\\nall the old comforts and cheer had departed was dreadfully\\nheartrending.\\"[110]\\nThat night \\"we slept badly till the morning and, therefore, late. After\\nbreakfast we went up the hills; there was a keen S.E. breeze, but the sun\\nshone and my spirits revived. There was very much less snow everywhere\\nthan I had ever seen. The ski run was completely cut through in two\\nplaces, the Gap and Observation Hill almost bare, a great bare slope on\\nthe side of Arrival Heights, and on top of Crater Heights an immense bare\\ntable-land. How delighted we should have been to see it like this in the\\nold days! The pond was thawed and the confervae green in fresh water. The\\nhole which we had dug in the mound in the pond was still there, as Meares\\ndiscovered by falling into it up to his waist, and getting very wet.\\n\\"On the south side we could see the pressure ridges beyond Pram Point as\\nof old--Horseshoe Bay calm and unpressed--the sea-ice pressed on Pram\\nPoint and along the Gap ice front, and a new ridge running around C.\\nArmitage about 2 miles off. We saw Ferrar\'s old thermometer tubes\\nstanding out of the snow slope as though they\'d been placed yesterday.\\nVince\'s cross might have been placed yesterday--the paint was so fresh\\nand the inscription so legible.\\"[111]\\nWe had two officers who had been with Shackleton in his 1908\\nExpedition--Priestley, who was in our Northern Party, and Day, who was in\\ncharge of our motors. Priestley with two others sledged over to Cape\\nRoyds and has left an account of the old hut there:\\n\\"After pitching tent Levick and I went over to the hut to forage. On the\\nway I visited Derrick Point and took a large seven-pound tin of butter\\nwhile Levick opened up the hut. It was very dark inside but I pulled the\\nboarding down from the windows so that we could see all right. It was\\nvery funny to see everything lying about just as we had left it, in that\\nlast rush to get off in the lull of the blizzard. On Marston\'s bunk was a\\nsixpenny copy of the Story of Bessie Costrell, which some one had\\nevidently read and left open. Perhaps what brought the old times back\\nagain more than anything else was the fact that as I came out of the\\nlarder the sleeve of my wind clothes caught the tap of the copper and\\nturned it on. When I heard the drip of the water I turned instinctively\\nand turned the tap off, almost expecting to hear Bobs\' raucous voice\\ncursing me for my clumsiness. Perhaps what strikes one more forcibly than\\nanything else is the fact that nothing has been disturbed. On the table\\nwas the remains of a batch of bread that Bobs had cooked for us and that\\nwas only partially consumed before the Nimrod called for us. Some of the\\nrolls showed the impression of bites given to them in 1909. All round the\\nbread were the sauces, pickles, pepper and salt of our usual standing\\nlunch, and a half-opened tin of gingerbreads was a witness to the dryness\\nof the climate for they were still crisp as the day they were opened.\\n\\"In the cubicle near the larder were the loose tins that poor Armytage\\nand myself had collected from all round the hut before we left.\\n\\"On the shelves of my cubicle are still stacked the magazines and paper\\nbrought down by the relief ship. Nothing is changed at all except the\\ncompany. It is almost dismal. I expect to see people come in through the\\ndoor after a walk over the surrounding hills.\\n\\"We had not much time to look round us; for Campbell was cooking in the\\ntent, so we slung a few tins of jam, a plum-pudding, some tea, and\\ngingerbreads into a sack, and returned to camp. By this time it was\\nsnowing heavily and continued to do so after dinner so that we turned in\\nimmediately (1.30 P.M.) and went off to sleep.

We are getting so worked up that we should not be a bit surprised\\nto see a settlement of Japanese or some other such people some day when\\nwe stroll round towards Blacksand Beach. The Old Sport created some\\namusement this evening by opening a tin of Nestl\xe9\'s milk at both ends\\ninstead of making the two holes at one end. He informed us that he had\\ngot so used to using two whole tins of milk for cocoa for fourteen people\\nat night that he always opened them that way.\\n\\"As a consequence we have to spend most of our spare time making bungs to\\nkeep the milk in the tin.\\"[112]\\nMeanwhile, as was to be expected, the action of the, I suspect, abnormal\\nsummer sea temperature was showing its effect upon the sea-ice. Sea-ice\\nthaws from below when the temperature of the water rises. The northern\\nice goes out first here, being next to the open water, but big thaw pools\\nform at the same time wherever a current of water flows over shallows, as\\nat the end of Cape Evans, Hut Point and Cape Armitage.\\nOn January 17 the ice was breaking away between the point of Cape Evans\\nand the ship, although a road still remained fast between the ship and\\nthe shore. The ship began to get up steam, but the fast ice broke away\\nquickly that night. I believe they got steam in three hours, twelve hours\\nbeing the time generally allowed: only just in time, however, for she\\nbroke adrift as it was reported. The next morning she made fast to the\\nice only 200 yards from the ice-foot of the Cape.\\n\\"For the present the position is extraordinarily comfortable. With a\\nsoutherly blow she would simply bind on to the ice, receiving great\\nshelter from the end of the Cape. With a northerly blow she might turn\\nrather close to the shore, where the soundings run to three fathoms, but\\nbehind such a stretch of ice she could scarcely get a sea or swell\\nwithout warning. It looks a wonderfully comfortable little nook, but of\\ncourse one can be certain of nothing in this place; one knows from\\nexperience how deceptive the appearance of security may be.\\"[113]\\nThe ship\'s difficulties were largely due to the shortage of coal. Again\\non the night of January 20-21 we had an anxious time.\\n\\"Fearing a little trouble I went out of the hut in the middle of the\\nnight and saw at once that she was having a bad time--the ice was\\nbreaking with a northerly swell and the wind increasing, with the ship on\\ndead lee shore; luckily the ice anchors had been put well in on the floe\\nand some still held. Pennell was getting up steam and his men struggling\\nto replace the anchors.\\n\\"We got out the men and gave some help. At 6 steam was up, and I was\\nright glad to see the ship back out to windward, leaving us to recover\\nanchors and hawsers.\\"[114]\\nA big berg drove in just after the ship had got away, and grounded where\\nshe had been lying. The ship returned in the afternoon, and it seems that\\nshe was searching round for an anchorage, and trying to look behind this\\nberg. There was a strongish northerly wind blowing. The currents and\\nsoundings round Cape Evans were then unknown. The current was setting\\nstrongly from the north through the strip of sea which divides\\nInaccessible Island from Cape Evans, a distance of some two-thirds of a\\nmile. The engines were going astern, but the current and wind were too\\nmuch for her, and the ship ran aground, being fast for some considerable\\ndistance aft--some said as far as the mainmast.\\n\\"Visions of the ship failing to return to New Zealand and of sixty people\\nwaiting here arose in my mind with sickening pertinacity, and the only\\nconsolation I could draw from such imaginations was the determination\\nthat the southern work should go on as before--meanwhile the least ill\\npossible seemed to be an extensive lightening of the ship with boats as\\nthe tide was evidently high when she struck--a terribly depressing\\nprospect.\\n\\"Some three or four of us watched it gloomily from the shore whilst all\\nwas bustle on board, the men shifting cargo aft. Pennell tells me they\\nshifted 10 tons in a very short time.\\n\\"The first ray of hope came when by careful watching one could see that\\nthe ship was turning very slowly, then one saw the men running from side\\nto side and knew that an attempt was being made to roll her off. The\\nrolling produced a more rapid turning movement at first, and then she\\nseemed to hang again. But only for a short time; the engines had been\\ngoing astern all the time and presently a slight movement became\\napparent. But we only knew she was getting clear when we heard cheers on\\nboard, and more cheers from the whaler.\\n\\"Then she gathered stern way and was clear. The relief was\\nenormous.\\"[115]\\nAll this took some time, and Scott himself came back into the hut with us\\nand went on bagging provisions for the Dep\xf4t journey. At such times of\\nreal disaster he was a very philosophical man. We were not yet ready to\\ngo sledging, but on January 23 the ice in North Bay all went out, and\\nthat in South Bay began to follow it. Because this was our road to the\\nBarrier, it was suddenly decided that we must start on the Dep\xf4t journey\\nthe following day or perhaps not at all. Already it was impossible to get\\nsledges south off the Cape: but there was a way to walk the ponies along\\nthe land until they could be scrambled down a steep rubbly slope on to\\nsea-ice which still remained. Would it float away before we got there? It\\nwas touch and go. \\"One breathes a prayer that the Road holds for the few\\nremaining hours. It goes in one place between a berg in open water and a\\nlarge pool of the Glacier face--it may be weak in that part, and at any\\nmoment the narrow isthmus may break away. We are doing it on a very\\nnarrow margin.\\"[116]\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n    [84] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 77.\\n    [85] Thomson.\\n    [86] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 80.\\n    [87] Wilson\'s Journal, _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 613,\\n         614.\\n    [88] See Introduction, p. xxxv.\\n    [89] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 87.\\n    [90] The extreme south point of the island, a dozen miles farther,\\n         on one of whose minor headlands, Hut Point, stood the\\n         Discovery hut.\\n    [91] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 88-90.\\n    [92] Ibid. p. 91.\\n    [93] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 52-93.\\n    [94] Ibid. pp. 92-94.\\n    [95] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 111.\\n    [96] Ibid. p. 94.\\n    [97] Ibid. p. 100.\\n    [98] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 230.\\n    [99] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 113-114.\\n   [100] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 94-96.\\n   [101] Ibid. p. 106.\\n   [102] My own diary.\\n   [103] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 111.\\n   [104] My own diary.\\n   [105] _The South Pole_, vol. i. p. 278.\\n   [106] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 128.\\n   [107] Ibid. p. 129.\\n   [108] My own diary.\\n   [109] See Introduction, p. xxxiv.\\n   [110] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 122.\\n   [111] Ibid. pp. 122-123.\\n   [112] Priestley\'s diary.\\n   [113] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 127.\\n   [114] Ibid. p. 134.\\n   [115] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 136.\\n   [116] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 138.\\n\\n\\n","image":"C04.06.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.01","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The Dep\xf4t Journey begins in January 1911, and the team faces many challenges from the very start, from navigating crevasses and holes to over-packing sledges.

For weeks we had turned in at midnight\\ntoo tired to take off our clothes, and had been lucky if we were allowed\\nto sleep until 5 A.M. We had eaten our meals when we could, and we had\\nworked in the meantime just as hard as it was physically possible to do.\\nIf we sat down on a packing-case we went to sleep.\\nAnd we finally left the camp in a state of hurry bordering upon panic.\\nSince the ice to the south of us, the road to the Barrier, was being\\nnibbled away by thaw, winds and tides, it was impossible to lead the\\nponies down from the Cape on to the sea-ice. The open sea was before us\\nand on our right front. It was necessary to lead them up among the lava\\nblocks which lay on the escarpment of Erebus, south-eastwards towards\\nLand\'s End, and thence to slide them down a steep but rubbly slope to the\\nice which still remained. As a matter of fact that ice went out the very\\nnext day.\\nDuring the last two days provisions had been bagged with the utmost\\ndespatch; sledges packed; letters scribbled; clothing sorted and rough\\nalterations to it made. Scott was busy, with Bowers\' help, making such\\narrangements as could be suggested for a further year\'s stay, for which\\nthe ship was to order the necessaries. Oates was busy weighing out the\\npony food for the journey, sorting harness, and generally managing a most\\nunruly mob of ponies. Many were the arguments as to the relative value of\\na pair of socks or their equivalent weight in tobacco, for we were\\nallowed 12 lbs. of private gear apiece, to consist of everything which we\\ndid not habitually wear on our bodies. This included such things as:\\n    Sleeping-boots.\\n    Sleeping-socks.\\n    Extra pair of day socks.\\n    A shirt.\\n    Tobacco and pipe.\\n    Notebook for diary and pencil.\\n    Extra balaclava helmet.\\n    Extra woollen mitts.\\n    Housewife containing buttons, needles, darning needles,\\n           thread and wool.\\n    Extra pair of finnesko.\\n    Big safety-pins with which to hang up our socks.\\n    And perhaps one small book.\\nMy most vivid recollection of the day we started is the sight of Bowers,\\nout of breath, very hot, and in great pain from a bad knock which he had\\ngiven his knee against a rock, being led forward by his big pony Uncle\\nBill, over whom temporarily he had but little control. He had been left\\nbehind in the camp, giving last instructions about the storage of cases\\nand management of provisions, and had practically lost himself in trying\\nto follow us over what was then unknown ground. He was wearing all the\\nclothing which was not included in his personal gear, for he did not\\nthink it fair to give the pony the extra weight. He had bruised his leg\\nin an ugly way, and for many days he came to me to bandage it. He was\\nafraid that if he let the doctors see it they would forbid him to go\\nforward. He had had no sleep for seventy-two hours.\\nThat first night (January 24) we pitched our inexperienced camp not far\\nfrom Hut Point. But our first taste of sledging was not without incident.\\nStarting with the ponies only we walked them to Glacier Tongue, where the\\nice and open water joined, and as we went we watched the ship pass us out\\nin the Strait and moor up to the end of the Tongue. Getting the ponies\\nacross the Tongue with its shallow but numerous crevasses and holes was\\nticklish work, but we tethered them safely off the Terra Nova, which\\nmeanwhile was landing dogs, sledges and gear. Then we got some lunch on\\nboard. A large lead in the sea-ice to the south of the Tongue\\nnecessitated some hours\' work in man-hauling all sledges along the back\\nof the Tongue until a way could be found down on to safe ice. We then\\nfollowed with the ponies. \\"If a pony falls into one of these holes I\\nshall sit down and cry,\\" said Oates. Within three minutes my pony was\\nwallowing, with only his head and forelegs visible, in a mess of brash\\nand snow, which had concealed a crack in the sea-ice which was obviously\\nnot going to remain much longer in its present position. We got lashings\\nround him and hauled him out. Poor Guts! He was fated to drown: but in an\\nhour he appeared to have forgotten all about his mishap, and was pulling\\nhis first load towards Hut Point as gallantly as always.\\nThe next day we took further stores from the ship to the camp which had\\nformed. Some of these loads were to be left on the edge of the Barrier\\nwhen we got there, but for the present we had to relay, that is, take one\\nload forward and come back for another.\\nOn the 26th we sledged back to the ship for our last load, and said\\ngood-bye on the sea-ice to those men with whom we had already worked so\\nlong, to Campbell and his five companions who were to suffer so much, to\\ncheery Pennell and his ship\'s company.\\nBefore we left, Scott thanked Pennell and his men \\"for their splendid\\nwork. They have behaved like bricks, and a finer lot of men never sailed\\nin a ship.... It was a little sad to say farewell to all these good\\nfellows and Campbell and his men. I do most heartily trust that all will\\nbe successful in their ventures, for indeed their unselfishness and their\\ngenerous high spirit deserve reward. God bless them.\\"\\nFour of that Dep\xf4t party were never to see these men again, and Pennell,\\nCommander of the Queen Mary, went down with his ship in the battle of\\nJutland.\\nTwo days later, January 28, we sledged our first loads on to the Barrier.\\nBy that day we had done nearly ninety miles of relay work, first from the\\nship at Glacier Tongue to our camp off Hut Point, and then onwards. Those\\nfirst days of sledging were wonderful! What memories they must have\\nbrought to Scott and Wilson when to us, who had never seen them before,\\nthese much-discussed landmarks were almost like old friends. As we made\\nour way over the frozen sea every seal-hole was of interest, and every\\ntype of wind-swept snow a novelty. The peak of Terror opened out behind\\nthe crater of Erebus, and we walked under Castle Rock and Danger Slope\\nuntil, rounding the promontory, we saw the little jagged Hut Point, and\\non it the cross placed there to Vince\'s memory, all unchanged. There was\\nthe old Discovery hut and the Bay in which the Discovery lay, and from\\nwhich she was almost miraculously freed at the last moment, only to be\\nflung upon the shoal which runs out from the Point, where some tins of\\nthe old Discovery days lie on the bottom still and glint in the evening\\nsun.

Parties travelling to Hut Point and\\nbeyond in summer must keep well out from the Point and Cape Armitage. But\\nall haste was being made to transport the necessary stores on to the\\nBarrier surface, where a big home dep\xf4t could be made, so far as we could\\njudge, in safety. The pressure ridges in the sea-ice between Cape\\nArmitage and Pram Point, which are formed by the movement of the Barrier,\\nwere large, and in some of the hollows countless seals were playing in\\nthe water. Judging by the size of these ridges and by the thickness of\\nthis ice when it broke up, the ice south of Hut Point was at least two\\nyears old.\\nI well remember the day we took the first of our loads on to the Barrier.\\nI expect we were all a little excited, for to walk upon the Barrier for\\nthe first time was indeed an adventure: what kind of surface was it, and\\nhow about these beastly crevasses of which we had read so much? Scott was\\nahead, and so far as we could see there was nothing but the same level of\\nice all round--when suddenly he was above us, walking up the sloping and\\nquite invisible drift. A minute after and our ponies and sledges were up\\nand over the tide crack, and beneath us soft and yielding snow, very\\ndifferent from the hard wind-swept surface of the frozen sea, which we\\nhad just left. Really it was rather prosaic and a tame entrance. But the\\nBarrier is a tricky place, and it takes years to get to know her.\\nOn our outward journey this day Oates did his best to kill a seal. My own\\ntent was promised some kidneys if we were good, and our mouths watered\\nwith the prospect of the hoosh before us. The seal had been left for\\ndead, and when on our homeward way we neared the place of his demise\\nTitus went off to carve our dinner from him. The next thing we saw was\\nthe seal lolloping straight for his hole, while Oates did his best to\\nstab him. The quarry made off safely not much hurt, for, as we discovered\\nlater, a clasp-knife is quite useless to kill a seal. Oates returned with\\na bad cut, as his hand had slipped down the knife; and it was a long time\\nbefore he was allowed to forget it.\\nThis Barrier, which we were to know so well, was soft, too soft for the\\nponies, and apparently flat. Only to our left, some hundreds of yards\\ndistant, there were two little snowy mounds. We got out the telescope\\nwhich we carried, but could make nothing of them. While we held our\\nponies Scott walked towards them, and soon we saw him brushing away snow\\nand uncovering something dark beneath. They were tents, obviously left by\\nShackleton or his men when the Nimrod was embarking his Southern party\\nfrom the Barrier. They were snowed up outside, and iced up inside almost\\nto the caps. Afterwards we dug them out, a good evening\'s work. The\\nfabric was absolutely rotten, we just tore it down with our hands, but\\nthe bamboos and caps were as sound as ever. When we had dug down to the\\nfloor-cloth we found everything intact as when it was left. The cooker\\nwas there and a primus--Scott lighted it and cooked a meal; we often used\\nit afterwards. And there were Rowntree\'s cocoa, Bovril, Brand\'s extract\\nof beef, sheep\'s tongues, cheese and biscuits--all open to the snow and\\nall quite good. We ate them for several days. There is something\\nimpressive in these first meals off food which has been exposed for\\nyears.\\nIt was on a Saturday, January 28, that we took our first load a short\\nhalf-mile on to the Barrier and left it at a place afterwards known as\\nthe Fodder Dep\xf4t. Two days later we moved our camp 1 mile 1200 yards\\nfarther on to the Barrier and here was erected the main dep\xf4t, known as\\nSafety Camp. \'Safety\' because it was supposed that even if a phenomenal\\nbreak-up of sea-ice should occur, and take with it part of the Barrier,\\nthis place would remain. Subsequent events proved the supposition well\\nfounded. This short bit of Barrier sledging gave all of us food for\\nthought, for the surface was appallingly soft, and the poor ponies were\\nsinking deep. It was obvious that no animals could last long under such\\nconditions. But somehow Shackleton had got his four a long way.\\nThere was now no hurry, for there was plenty of food. It was only when we\\nwent on from here that we must economize food and travel fast. It was\\ndetermined to give the ponies a rest while we made the dep\xf4t and\\nrearranged sledges, which we did on the following day. We had with us one\\npair of pony snow-shoes, a circle of wire as a foundation, hooped round\\nwith bamboo, and with beckets of the same material. The surface suggested\\ntheir trial, which was completely successful. The question of snow-shoes\\nhad been long and anxiously considered, and shoes for all the ponies were\\nat Cape Evans; but as we had so lately landed from the ship the ponies\\nhad not been trained in their use, and they had not been brought.\\nScott immediately sent Wilson and Meares with a dog-team to see whether\\nthe sea-ice would allow them to reach Cape Evans and bring back shoes for\\nthe other ponies. Meanwhile the next morning saw us trying to accustom\\nthe animals to wearing snow-shoes by exercising them in the one pair we\\npossessed. But it seemed no use continuing to do this after the dog party\\ncame in. They had found the sea-ice gone between Glacier Tongue and\\nWinter Quarters and so were empty-handed. They reported that a crevasse\\nat the edge of the Tongue had opened under the sledge, which had tilted\\nback into the crevasse but had run over it. These Glacier Tongue\\ncrevasses are shallow things; Gran fell into one later and walked out of\\nthe side of the Tongue on to the sea-ice beyond!\\nIt was determined to start on the following day with five weeks\'\\nprovisions for men and animals; to go forward for about fourteen days,\\ndep\xf4t two weeks\' provisions and return. Most unfortunately Atkinson would\\nhave to be left behind with Crean to look after him. He had chafed his\\nfoot, and the chafe had suppurated. To his great disappointment there was\\nno alternative but to lie up. Luckily we had another tent, and there was\\nthe cooker and primus we had dug out of Shackleton\'s tent. Poor Crean was\\nto spend his spare time in bringing up loads from the Fodder Dep\xf4t to\\nSafety Camp and, worse still from his point of view, dig a hole downwards\\ninto the Barrier for scientific observations!\\nWe left the following morning, February 2, and marched on a patchy\\nsurface for five miles (Camp 4). The temperature was above zero and Scott\\ndecided to see whether the surface was not better at night. On the whole,\\nit is problematical whether this is the case--we came to the conclusion\\nlater that the ideal surface for pulling a sledge on ski was found at a\\ntemperature of about +16\xb0. But there is no doubt whatever that ponies\\nshould do their work at night, when the temperature is colder, and rest\\nand sleep when the sun has its greatest altitude and power. And so we\\ncamped and turned in to our sleeping-bags at 4 P.M. and marched again\\nsoon after midnight, doing five miles before and five miles after lunch:\\nlunch, if you please, being about 1 A.M., and a very good time, for just\\nthen the daylight seemed to be thin and bleak and one always felt the\\ncold.\\nOur road lay eastwards through the Strait, some twenty-five miles in\\nwidth, which runs between the low, rather uninteresting scarp of White\\nIsland to the south, and the beautiful slopes of Erebus and Terror to the\\nnorth. This part of the Barrier is stagnant, but the main stream in front\\nof us, unchecked by land, flows uninterruptedly northwards towards the\\nRoss Sea. Only where the stream presses against the Bluff, White Island\\nand, most important of all, Cape Crozier, and rubs itself against the\\nnearly stationary ice upon which we were travelling, pressures and\\nrendings take place, forming some nasty crevasses. It was intended to\\nsteer nearly east until this line was crossed some distance north of\\nWhite Island, and then steer due south.\\nIt is most difficult on a large snow surface to say whether it is flat.\\nCertainly there are plenty of big crevasses for several miles in this\\nneighbourhood, though they are generally well covered, and we found only\\nvery small ones on this outward journey. I am inclined to think there are\\nalso some considerable pressure waves. As we came up to Camp 5 we\\nfloundered into a pocket of soft snow in which one pony after another\\nplunged deeper and deeper until they were buried up to their bellies and\\ncould move no more. I suppose it was an old crevasse filled with soft\\nsnow, or perhaps one of the pressure-ridge hollows which had been\\nrecently drifted up. My own pony somehow got through with his sledge to\\nthe other side, and every moment I expected the ground to fall below us\\nand a chasm to swallow us up. The others had to be unharnessed and led\\nout. The only set of snow-shoes was then put on to Bowers\' big pony and\\nhe went back and drew the stranded sledges out. Beyond we pitched our\\ncamp.","image":"C05.02.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.03","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The team experiences their first Barrier blizzard; the ponies suffer the most, and two become practically useless.

In the last five\\nmiles we crossed several crevasses, our first; and I heard Oates ask some\\none what they looked like. \\"Black as hell,\\" he said, but we saw no more\\njust now, for this march carried us beyond the line of pressure which\\nruns between White Island and Cape Crozier. This halt was called Corner\\nCamp, as we turned here and marched due south. Corner Camp will be heard\\nof again and again in this story: it is thirty miles from Hut Point.\\nBy 4 P.M. it was blowing our first Barrier blizzard. We were to find out\\nafterwards that a Corner Camp blizzard blows nearly as often as a Hut\\nPoint wind. The Bluff seems to be the breeding-place for these\\ndisturbances, which pour out towards the sea by way of Cape Crozier.\\nCorner Camp is in the direct line between the two.\\nOne summer blizzard is much like another. The temperature, never very\\nlow, rises, and you are not cold in the tent. Sometimes a blizzard is a\\nvery welcome rest: after weeks of hard pulling, dragging yourself awake\\neach morning, feeling as though you had only just gone to sleep, with\\nthe mental strain perhaps which work among crevasses entails, it is most\\npleasant to be put to bed for two or three days. You may sleep\\ndreamlessly nearly all the time, rousing out for meals, or waking\\noccasionally to hear from the soft warmth of your reindeer bag the deep\\nboom of the tent flapping in the wind, or drowsily you may visit other\\nparts of the world, while the drifting snow purrs against the green tent\\nat your head.\\nBut outside there is raging chaos. It is blowing a full gale: the air is\\nfull of falling snow, and the wind drives this along and adds to it the\\nloose snow which is lying on the surface of the Barrier. Fight your way a\\nfew steps away from the tent, and it will be gone. Lose your sense of\\ndirection and there is nothing to guide you back. Expose your face and\\nhands to the wind, and they will very soon be frost-bitten. And this at\\nmidsummer. Imagine the added cold of spring and autumn: the cold and\\ndarkness of winter.\\nThe animals suffer most, and during this first blizzard all our ponies\\nwere weakened, and two of them became practically useless. It must be\\nremembered that they had stood for five weeks upon a heaving deck; they\\nhad been through one very bad gale: the time during which we were\\nunloading the ship was limited, and since that time they had dragged\\nheavy loads the greater part of 200 miles. Nothing was left undone for\\nthem which we could manage, but necessarily the Antarctic is a grim place\\nfor ponies. I think Scott felt the sufferings of the ponies more than the\\nanimals themselves. It was different for the dogs. These fairly warm\\nblizzards were only a rest for them. Snugly curled up in a hole in the\\nsnow they allowed themselves to be drifted over. Bieleglas and Vaida, two\\nhalf brothers who pulled side by side, always insisted upon sharing one\\nhole, and for greater warmth one would lie on the top of the other. At\\nintervals of two hours or so they fraternally changed places.\\nThis blizzard lasted three days.\\nWe now marched nearly due south, the open Barrier in front, Mount Terror\\nand the sea behind, for five days, covering fifty-four miles, when, being\\nnow level with the southern extremity of the Bluff, we laid the Bluff\\nDep\xf4t. The bearings of Bluff Dep\xf4t, as well as those of Corner Camp, are\\ngiven in Scott\'s Last Expedition.\\nThe characteristics of these days were the collapse of two of the ponies,\\nBl\xfccher and Blossom, and the partial collapse of a third, Jimmy Pigg,\\nalthough the surface hardened, becoming a marbled series of wind-swept\\nridges and domes in this region. For the rest the new hands were finding\\nout how to keep warm on the Barrier, how to pitch a tent and cook a meal\\nin twenty minutes, and the thousand and one little tips which only\\nexperience can teach. But all the care in the world could do little for\\nthe poor ponies.\\nIt must be confessed at once that some of these ponies were very poor\\nmaterial, and it must be conceded that Oates who was in charge of them\\nstarted with a very great handicap. From first to last it was Oates\'\\nconsummate management, seconded by the care and kindness of the ponies\'\\nleaders, which obtained results which often exceeded the most sanguine\\nhopes.\\nOne evening we watched Scott digging crumbly blocks of snow out of the\\nBarrier and building a rough wall, something like a grouse butt, to the\\nsouth of his pony. In our inmost hearts I fear we viewed these\\nproceedings with distrust, and saw in it but little usefulness,--one\\nlittle bit of leaky wall in a great plain of snow. But a very little wind\\n(which you must understand comes almost invariably from the south)\\nconvinced us from personal experience what a boon these walls could be.\\nHenceforward every night on camping each pony leader built a wall behind\\nhis pony while his pemmican was cooking, and came out after supper to\\nfinish this wall before he turned in to his sleeping-bag--no small thing\\nwhen you consider that the warmth of your hours of rest depends largely\\nupon getting into your bag immediately you have eaten your hoosh and\\ncocoa. And not seldom you might hear a voice in your dreams: \\"Bill!\\nNobby\'s kicked his wall down\\"; and out Bill would go to build it up\\nagain.\\n[Illustration: DOGSKIN \'MITTS\']\\n[Illustration: SLEDGING SPOON, CUP AND PANNIKIN]\\nOates wished to take certain of the ponies as far south as possible on\\nthe Dep\xf4t journey, and then to kill them and leave the meat there as a\\ndep\xf4t of dog food for the Polar Journey. Scott was against this plan.\\nHere at Bluff Dep\xf4t he decided to send back the three weakest ponies\\n(Blossom, Bl\xfccher and Jimmy Pigg, with their leaders, Lieutenant Evans,\\nForde and Keohane). They started back the next morning (February 13)\\nwhile the remainder of the party went forward over a surface which\\ngradually became softer as we left behind the windy region of the Bluff.\\nWe now had with us the two teams of dogs, driven by Meares and Wilson,\\nand five ponies.\\n    Scott with \'Nobby.\'\\n    Oates with \'Punch.\'\\n    Bowers with \'Uncle Bill.\'\\n    Gran with \'Weary Willie.\'\\n    Cherry-Garrard with \'Guts.\'\\nScott, Wilson, Meares and myself inhabited one tent, Bowers, Oates and\\nGran the other. Scott was evolving in his mind means by which ponies\\nshould follow one another in a string, the second pony with his leading\\nrein fastened to the back of the sledge of the first and so on, the\\ncavalcade to be managed by two or three men only, instead of one man to\\nlead each pony.\\nSunday night (February 12) we started from Bluff Dep\xf4t and did seven\\nmiles before lunch against a considerable drift and wind. It was pretty\\ncold, and ten minutes after we left our lunch camp with the ponies it was\\nblowing a full blizzard. The dog party had not started, so we camped and\\nslept five in the four-man tent, and it was by no means uncomfortable.\\nProbably this was the time when Scott first thought of taking a five-man\\nparty to the Pole. By Monday evening the blizzard was over, the dogs came\\nup, and we did 6\xbd miles of very heavy going. Gran\'s pony, Weary Willie, a\\nsluggish and obstinate animal, was far behind, as usual, when we halted\\nour ponies at the camping place. Farther off the dog-teams were coming\\nup. What happened never became clear. Poor Weary, it seems, was in\\ndifficulties in a snow-drift: the dogs of one team being very hungry\\ntook charge of their sledge and in a moment were on the horse, to all\\npurposes a pack of ravenous wolves. Gran and Weary made a good fight and\\nthe dogs were driven off, but Weary came into camp without his sledge,\\ncovered with blood and looking very sick.\\nWe halted after doing only \xbe mile more after lunch; for the pony was\\ndone, and little wonder. The following day we did 7\xbd miles with\\ndifficulty, both Uncle Bill and Weary Willie going very slowly and\\nstopping frequently. The going was very deep. The ponies were fast giving\\nout, and it was evident that we had much to learn as to their use on the\\nBarrier; they were thin and very hungry; their rations were\\nunsatisfactory; and the autumn temperatures and winds were beyond their\\nstrength. We went on one more day in a minus twenty temperature and light\\nairs, and then in latitude 79\xb0 29\xb4 S. it was determined to lay the dep\xf4t,\\nwhich was afterwards known as One Ton, and return. In view of subsequent\\nevents it should be realized that this dep\xf4t was just a cairn of snow in\\nwhich were buried food and oil, and over which a flag waved on a bamboo.\\nThere is no land visible from One Ton except on a very clear day and it\\nis 130 geographical miles from Hut Point.","image":"C05.03.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.04","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"Scott splits the party into two groups for the return journey and takes the dog-teams to quickly obtain news of another expedition\'s landing.

Scott was satisfied with the result, and\\nindeed this dep\xf4t ensured that we could start southwards for the Pole\\nfully laden from this point.\\nHere the party was again split into two for the return. Scott was anxious\\nto get such news about the landing of Campbell\'s party on King Edward\\nVII.\'s Land as the ship should have left at Hut Point on her return\\njourney. He decided to take the two dog-teams, the first with himself and\\nMeares, the second with Wilson and myself, and make a quick return,\\nleaving Bowers with Oates and Gran to help him to bring back the five\\nponies, driving them one behind the other.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nTHE RETURN OF THE PONY PARTY FROM ONE TON DEP\xd4T\\n(_From a Letter written by Bowers_)\\nAs our loads were so light Titus thought it would be better for the\\nponies to do their full march in one stretch and so have a longer rest.\\nWe, therefore, decided to forgo lunch and have a good meal on camping.\\nThe recent trails were fresh enough to follow and so saved us steering by\\ncompass, which is very difficult as the needle will only come to rest\\nafter you have been standing still for about a minute. That march was\\nextraordinary, the snowy mist hid all distant objects and made all close\\nones look gigantic. Although we were walking on a flat undulating plain,\\none could not get away from the impression that the ground was\\nhilly--quite steep in places with deep hollows by the wayside. Suddenly a\\nherd of apparent cattle would appear in the distance, then you would\\nthink, \'No, it\'s a team of dogs broken loose and rushing towards you.\' In\\nanother moment one would be walking over the black dots of some old horse\\ndroppings which had been the cause of the hallucinations. Since then I\\nhave often been completely taken in by appearances under certain\\nconditions of light, and the novelty has worn off. Sastrugi are the hard\\nwaves formed by wind on a snow surface; these are seldom more than a foot\\nor so in height, and often so obscured as to be imperceptible\\nirregularities. On this occasion they often appeared like immense ridges\\nuntil you walked over them. After going about 10 miles we spotted a tiny\\nblack triangle in the dead white void ahead, it was over a mile away and\\nwas the lunch camp of the dogs. We were fairly close before they broke\\ncamp and hurriedly packed up. I thought they looked rather sheepish at\\nhaving been caught up, like the hare and the tortoise again. Still we had\\nbeen marching very quickly and Scott was delighted to see Weary Willie\\ngoing so well. They then dashed off, and after completing just over 12\\nmiles we reached Pagoda Cairn where a bale of fodder had been left.\\nHere we camped and threw up our walls as quickly as possible to shelter\\nthe beasts from the cold wind. Weary was the most annoying, he would\\ndeliberately back into his wall and knock the whole structure down. In\\nthe case of my own pony, I had to put the wall out of his reach as his\\naim in life was to eat it, generally beginning at the bottom. He would\\ndiligently dislodge a block, and bring down the whole fabric. One cannot\\nbe angry with the silly beggars--Titus says a horse has practically no\\nreasoning power, the thing to do is simply to throw up another wall and\\nkeep on at it.\\nThe weather cleared during the night, and the next day, February 19, we\\nstarted off under ideal conditions, the sun was already dipping pretty\\nlow, marks easy to pick up, and on this occasion we could plainly see a\\ncairn over seven miles away, raised by the mirage; the only trouble about\\nseeing things so far off is that they take such an awful time to reach.\\nMirage is a great feature down here and one of the most common of optical\\nphenomena on the Barrier; it is often difficult to persuade oneself that\\nopen water does not lie ahead. We passed the scene of Weary Willie\'s\\nfight with the dogs during the march and also had an amusing argument as\\nto a dark object on the snow ahead. At first we thought it was the dog\\ncamp again, but it turned out to be an empty biscuit tin, such is the\\ndeceptive nature of the light. Later we sighted our old blizzard camp and\\ndecided to utilize the walls again. Weary Willie was decidedly worse and\\nhad to be literally jumped along by the pony to which he was attached.\\nWithin half a mile of the walls Weary refused to go farther, and after\\nwasting some time in vain efforts to urge him on we had to camp where we\\nwere, having only done 10\xbd miles. This was very sad, but I took hope from\\nthe fact that Titus, who is usually pretty pessimistic, had not yet given\\nup hopes of getting him back alive. He had an extra whack of oats at the\\nexpense of the other ponies, and my big beast made up for his shortage by\\nhauling the sledge towards him with his tethered leg, and forcing his\\nnose into our precious biscuit tank, out of which he helped himself\\nliberally at our expense. The sledges were now too light to anchor the\\nanimals, so we had to peg them down with anything we could and bank them\\nup with snow.\\nWeary was better the next day (February 20) but we decided at the outset\\nto go no farther than the Bluff Camp where we had left some fodder. This\\nwas barely 10 miles off, yet my old animal showed signs of lassitude\\nbefore the end; there was nothing alarming, however, and we saw the dep\xf4t\\nover five miles off which interested the beasts, who see these things and\\nsomehow connect them, in the backs of their silly old heads, with food\\nand rest. Weary Willie made a decided improvement, so we camped in high\\nspirits. Captain Scott had asked me if possible to take some theodolite\\nobservations for the determination of the position of Bluff Camp. Ours is\\nmuch farther off and farther beyond the Bluff than the old Discovery\\nDep\xf4t A, which was practically the same position Shackleton used. In both\\ncases, Scott and Shackleton were keeping nearer the coast; now, however,\\nthat the Beardmore has been discovered we can aim straight for that,\\nwhich takes one farther east by at least 15 miles off the Bluff. This is\\nrather an advantage, I think, as close in to this remarkable headland the\\nonward movement of the Barrier arrested by the immovable hills causes a\\nterrific chaos of crevasses off the cliffs at the end. These extend many\\nmiles and include some chasms big enough to take the Terra Nova all\\nstanding. Needless to remark, one is well clear of this sort of scenery\\nwith ponies--hence our course. I was unable to get any observations,\\nunfortunately, as it clouded over almost at once and later in the day\\nstarted to snow without wind. This often happens before a bliz, and as we\\nwere anxious about the ponies to say nothing of our own shortage of\\nbiscuit we felt a trifle apprehensive. It was very gloomy when we left\\ncamp at midnight, as the midnight sun was already cartwheeling the\\nsouthern horizon, the first sign of autumn, also the season had\\nundoubtedly broken up, and the sky was covered with low stratus clouds as\\nthick as a hedge. We lost sight of the cairn almost at once and followed\\nthe remains of old tracks for a little while till the snowy gloom made it\\nimpossible to see them. You will remember that it was at the Bluff Camp\\nthat Teddy Evans returned with the three weak ponies, so there were\\nplenty of traces of our march now. Just on four miles from the start I\\nsaw a small mound some distance to the west, and struck over there: it\\nwas a small cairn without the signs of a camp and rather puzzled me at\\nthe time. As I shall mention it later I will call it X for convenience.\\nWe then pushed on and I found steering most difficult. In the fuzzy\\nnothingness ahead one could see no point on which to fix the eye, and the\\ncompass required standing still to look at it every time. Our sledging\\ncompasses are spirit ones, and as steady as a small hand compass could\\npossibly be. You will understand, however, that owing to the proximity of\\nthe Magnetic Pole the pull on the needle is chiefly downwards. It is\\nforced into a horizontal position by a balancing weight on the N. side,\\nso it is obvious that its direction power is greatly reduced.

However, we plodded along with frequent stoppages\\ntill the wind came away, and then having determined the direction of\\nthat, steered by keeping the snow on our backs. The wind was not strong\\nenough to be unpleasant, and all was well. We legged it into the void for\\nnearly seven miles beyond X Cairn when I suddenly found myself only a few\\nyards away from another cairn. This shows that somehow, without the use\\nof tracks or landmarks, we had marched seven miles without being able to\\nsee thirty yards, and had yet hit off the direct track to a T; of course,\\nit was only coincidence, though some people might credit themselves with\\nsuperlative navigating powers on such evidence. The wind increased, and\\nwith the knowledge I now have of blizzards I would camp at once. Then I\\nthought it better to shove on, as the ponies were marching splendidly.\\nThe danger lay in the fact that though it is easy enough for you to\\nmarch with the wind behind, you can\'t march for ever and you will\\nprobably get tired before the wind does. Camping in a stiff breeze is\\nalways difficult, to say nothing of a gale; and for three men with five\\nponies to manage would be wellnigh impossible. Fortunately for us this\\nwas not really a blizzard, though it was quite near enough to one. The\\nsky broke later and showed the Bluff and White Island, and then the\\nscurrying clouds of drift would encircle us to break again and come on\\nagain.\\nAfter having done seventeen miles we got a lull and stopped to camp right\\naway. We were pretty quick about it, and fortunately got the ponies\\npicketed, and tent pitched, before the wind came down on us again. We\\nwere pretty hungry by the time the walls were erected. Still we were\\nquite happy, ate everything we could get, except the three lumps of sugar\\nI always kept for old Uncle Bill out of my whack. The little blow blew\\nitself out towards evening and in perfect calm and sunshine I got a\\nsplendid set of observations. Erebus and Terror were showing up as clear\\nas a bell and I got a large number of angles for Evans\' survey. We\\nstarted out as usual, and had the most pleasant, as well as the longest,\\nof our return marches on the last day of summer, February 22. We did\\neighteen miles right off the reel, the sun was brilliant from midnight\\nonwards. He now half immersed himself below the horizon for a short\\ninterval once in 24 hours. All old cairns were visible a tremendous\\ndistance, six or seven miles at least for big ones. Mount Terror lay\\nstraight ahead and looked so clear that it seemed impossible to imagine\\nit 70 miles away. At the end of our march we saw a small cairn beyond our\\n8th outward camp mound. Nobody would have rigged up another cairn so\\nclose without an object, so the thought of a dead horse flashed through\\nmy mind at once. Titus was so sure that Bl\xfccher would never get back,\\nthat he had bet Gran a biscuit on it. I saw the cairn had a fodder bale\\non the top, and later saw a note made fast to the wire. It was in Teddy\\nEvans\' handwriting and to our surprise recorded Blossom\'s death. Titus\\nwas so sure that Blossom would survive Bl\xfccher that we started to think\\nback and thus the mystery of X Cairn was clear to me. I was quite certain\\nnow that both the ancient ponies had died and that Jimmy Pigg had\\nreturned alone. The following day (February 23) was a good marching day\\nalso, but a bit cloudy latterly. We did fourteen miles as this evidence\\nof pony failure made us all the more anxious about ours, though really\\nthey were going very well. About eight miles on we came to one of Evans\'\\ncamps and the solitary pony wall told its own tale of the death of the\\nother two. He must have had a miserable return. At eleven miles there\\nwere two bales of fodder dep\xf4ted, we were only 50 miles odd from our\\ndestination off Cape Armitage, and had one meal over three days\' food.\\nIf, therefore, we could average 15 miles a day that would suffice. It was\\na silly risk in view of blizzards and other possibilities, chiefly our\\nown inexperience. As it was I took it and left the fodder there for next\\nyear.\\nFebruary 24 was another march into impenetrable gloom. Fortunately Corner\\nCamp, though dark enough, was not shaded in mist. I examined it for notes\\nand evidence and found some. The sun set properly now, and had we been\\nfarther from home I should have changed to day marching. I have seldom\\nseen such a scene of utter desolation as Corner Camp presented on that\\ngloomy day. The fog then settled down and like people of the mist, we\\nstruck off blindly to the N.W. At 3.15 A.M. a light S. breeze came away;\\nI dreaded a blizzard with so little pony food, and already regretted my\\nfolly in leaving the fodder. After doing twelve miles we had to camp, as\\nit was impossible even to march straight in the white haze. We made five\\ncolossal walls and turned in, hoping for the best. Fortune favours the\\nreckless, as well as the brave, at times, and it did this time, as the\\nblizzard still held off. The signs of one impending were unmistakable\\nnotwithstanding. Weary Willie did less well on February 25, and as the\\nsurface became heavier, we had to camp after only doing eleven miles.\\nI thought best in view of the threatening appearance of the weather to\\nhave a six hours\' rest, and march into Safety Camp the same day, a\\ndistance of eight miles. We found to our horror that Gran had dropped\\nthe top cap of our primus at the last camp. Cold food stared us in face!\\nHowever, we did manage to melt some snow for a cheering drink by cutting\\na piece of tin as near the shape of the cap as possible. Our biscuit was\\nfinished owing to the ravages of my pony. Before turning in I saw some\\nspecks to the N. and skipping my theodolite on its tripod, looked through\\nthe telescope and saw two tents and a number of ski stuck up. [This was\\nScott\'s man-hauling party together with Jimmy Pigg, going out to Corner\\nCamp.] This we concluded was either a man-hauling, or man and beast party\\nbound for Corner Camp. We overslept and so did not get away till the\\nafternoon. It was still very cloudy and threatening. I found that I had\\nsteered considerably to the southward of the right direction in the fog,\\nand it is lucky we met with no crevasses off White Island. Safety Camp at\\nlast appeared, and the last four miles seemed interminable. We had given\\nthe animals their last feed before starting, not a particle remained, but\\nthey stuck it. The surface was very heavy. Once, however, that they had\\nseen the camp they never stopped. I suppose they knew they were nearly\\nhome. We marched in about 9.30 P.M. I said \'Thank God\' when I looked at\\nthe weather, and the empty sledges. The dogs were in camp, also the dome\\ntent [we had some tents shaped like a dome in addition to those we used\\nfor sledging], out of which Uncle Bill (the real \'Uncle Bill Wilson\') and\\nMeares emerged. We soon had the ponies behind walls and well fed,\\nborrowed their primus for ourselves, and had a square meal of pemmican\\nand biscuit with fids of seal liver in it.\\n(End of Bowers\' Account.)\\n\\nTHE RETURN OF THE DOG PARTY\\nThe history of the dog-teams was eventful. We travelled fast, doing\\nnearly 78 miles in the first three days, by which time we were\\napproaching Corner Camp. The dogs were thin and hungry and we were\\npushing them each day just so long as they could pull, running ourselves\\nfor the most part. Scott determined to cut the corner, that is to miss\\nCorner Camp and cut diagonally across our outward track. It was not\\nexpected that this would bring us across any badly crevassed area.\\nWe started on the evening of February 20 in a very bad light. It was\\ncoldish, with no wind. After going about three miles I saw a drop in the\\nlevel of the Barrier which the sledge was just going to run over. I\\nshouted to Wilson to look out, but he had already jumped on to the sledge\\n(for he was running) having seen Stareek put his paws through. It was a\\nnasty crevasse, about twenty feet across with blue holes on both sides.\\nThe sledge ran over and immediately on the opposite side was brought up\\nby a large \'haystack\' of pressure which we had not seen owing to the\\nlight. Meares\' team, on our left, never saw any sign of pressure. The\\nlight was so bad that we never saw this cairn of ice until we ran into\\nit.\\nWe ran level for another two miles, Meares and Scott on our left. We were\\nevidently crossing many crevasses. Quite suddenly we saw the dogs of\\ntheir team disappearing, following one another, just like dogs going down\\na hole after some animal.\\n\\"In a moment,\\" wrote Scott, \\"the whole team were sinking--two by two we\\nlost sight of them, each pair struggling for foothold. Osman the leader\\nexerted all his strength and kept a foothold--it was wonderful to see\\nhim. The sledge stopped and we leapt aside. The situation was clear in\\nanother moment. We had been actually travelling along the bridge [or snow\\ncovering] of a crevasse, the sledge had stopped on it, whilst the dogs\\nhung in their harness in the abyss, suspended between the sledge and the\\nleading dog. Why the sledge and ourselves didn\'t follow the dogs we shall\\nnever know.\\"\\nWe of the other sledge stopped hurriedly, tethered our team and went to\\ntheir assistance with the Alpine rope. Osman, the big leader, was in\\ngreat difficulties. He crouched resisting with all his enormous strength\\nthe pull of the rope upon which the team hung in their harness in mid\\nair. It was clear that if Osman gave way the sledge and dogs would\\nprobably all be lost down the crevasse.","image":"C05.05.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.06","output":"The passage describes how the team rescued dogs that had fallen into a crevasse while traveling on the Barrier, and how some of their dogs died during the journey, with Scott receiving news of Amundsen\'s success in establishing his base at the Bay of Whales.

Scott and\\nMeares then tried to pull up the rope from Osman\'s end, while we hung on\\nto the sledge to prevent it slipping down the crevasse. They could not\\nmove it an inch. We then put the strain as much as possible on to a peg.\\nMeanwhile two dogs had fallen out of their harness into the crevasse and\\ncould be seen lying on a snow-ledge some 65 feet down. Later they curled\\nup and went to sleep. Another dog as he hung managed to get some purchase\\nfor his feet on the side of the crevasse, and a free fight took place\\namong several more of them, as they dangled, those that hung highest\\nusing the backs of those under them to get a purchase.\\n\\"It takes one a little time,\\" wrote Scott, \\"to make plans under such\\nsudden circumstances, and for some minutes our efforts were rather\\nfutile. We could not get an inch on the main trace of the sledge or on\\nthe leading rope, which was binding Osman to the snow with a throttling\\npressure. Then thought became clearer. We unloaded our sledge, putting in\\nsafety our sleeping-bags with the tent and cooker. Choking sounds from\\nOsman made it clear that the pressure on him must soon be relieved. I\\nseized the lashing off Meares\' sleeping-bag, passed the tent poles across\\nthe crevasse, and with Meares managed to get a few inches on the leading\\nline; this freed Osman, whose harness was immediately cut.\\n\\"Then securing the Alpine rope to the main trace we tried to haul up\\ntogether. One dog came up and was unlashed, but by this time the rope had\\ncut so far back at the edge that it was useless to attempt to get more of\\nit. But we could now unbend the sledge, and do that for which we should\\nhave aimed from the first, namely, run the sledge across the gap and work\\nfrom it. We managed to do this, our fingers constantly numbed. Wilson\\nheld on to the anchored trace whilst the rest of us laboured at the\\nleader end. The leading rope was very small and I was fearful of its\\nbreaking, so Meares was lowered down a foot or two to secure the Alpine\\nrope to the leading end of the trace; this done, the work of rescue\\nproceeded in better order. Two by two we hauled the animals up to the\\nsledge and one by one cut them out of their harness. Strangely the last\\ndogs were the most difficult, as they were close under the lip of the\\ngap, bound in by the snow-covered rope. Finally, with a gasp we got the\\nlast poor creature on to firm snow. We had recovered eleven of the\\nthirteen.\\"[117]\\nThe dogs had been dangling for over an hour, and some of them showed\\nsigns of internal injuries. Meanwhile the two remaining dogs were lying\\ndown the crevasse on a snow-ledge. Scott proposed going down on the\\nAlpine rope to get them; all his instincts of kindness were aroused, as\\nwell as the thought of the loss of two of the team. Wilson thought it was\\na mad idea and very dangerous, and said so, asking however whether he\\nmight not go down instead of Scott if anybody had to go. Scott insisted,\\nand we paid down the 90-foot Alpine rope to test the distance. The ledge\\nwas about 65 feet below. We lowered Scott, who stood on the ledge while\\nwe hauled up the two dogs in turn. They were glad to see him, and little\\nwonder!\\nBut the rescued dogs which were necessarily running about loose on the\\nBarrier, in their mangled harnesses, chose this moment to start a free\\nfight with the other team. With a hurried shout down the crevasse we had\\nto rush off to separate them. Nougis I. had been considerably mauled\\nbefore this was done--also, incidentally, my heel! But at last we\\nseparated them, and hauled Scott to the surface. It was all three of us\\ncould do and our fingers were frost-bitten towards the end.\\nScott\'s interest in the incident, apart from the recovery of the dogs,\\nwas scientific. Since we were running across the line of cleavage when\\nthe dogs went down, it was to be expected that we should be crossing the\\ncrevasses at right angles, and not be travelling, as actually happened,\\nparallel to, or along them. While we were getting him up the sixty odd\\nfeet to which we had lowered him he kept muttering: \\"I wonder why this is\\nrunning the way it is--you expect to find them at right angles,\\" and\\nwhen down the crevasse he wanted to go off exploring, but we managed to\\npersuade him that the snow-ledge upon which he was standing was utterly\\nunsafe, and indeed we could see the nothingness below through the blue\\nholes in the shelf. Another regret was that we had no thermometer: the\\ntemperature of the inside of the Barrier is of great interest and a\\nfairly reliable record of the average temperature throughout the year\\nmight have been obtained when so far down into it. Altogether we could\\ncongratulate ourselves on a fortunate ending to a nasty business. We\\nexpected several more miles of crevasses, and the wind was getting up,\\ndriving the surface drift like smoke over the ground, with a very black\\nsky to the south. We pitched the tent, had a good meal and mended the dog\\nharness which had been ruthlessly cut in clearing the dogs. Luckily we\\nfound no more crevasses for it was now blowing hard, and rescue work\\nwould have been difficult, and we pushed on as far as possible that\\nnight, doing eleven miles after lunch, and sixteen for the day. It had\\nbeen strenuous, for we had been working in or over the crevasse for 2\xbd\\nhours, and dogs and men were tired out. It cleared and became quite warm\\nas we camped. There was a pleasant air of friendship in the tent that\\nnight, rather more than usual. That is generally the result of this kind\\nof business.\\nWe reached Safety Camp next day (February 22) anxious for news of the\\nship\'s doings, the landing of Campbell\'s party, and of the ponies which\\nhad been sent back from the Bluff Dep\xf4t. Lieutenant Evans, Forde and\\nKeohane, the pony leaders, were there, but only one pony. The other two\\nhad died of exhaustion soon after they left us and we had passed the\\ncairns which marked their graves without knowledge. Their story was grim,\\nand they had had a mournful journey back. First Blossom, and then Bl\xfccher\\ncollapsed, their ends being hastened by the blizzard of February 1.\\nThis crevasse incident, followed by the news of the loss of the ponies,\\nwas a blow to Scott, and his mind was also uneasy about Atkinson and\\nCrean, whom we had left here, and who had disappeared leaving no record.\\nNor was the report from the Terra Nova here, so we judged that the\\nmissing men and the report must be at Hut Point. After three or four\\nhours\' sleep, and a cup of tea and a biscuit, we started man-hauling with\\ncooker and sleeping-bags: the former because we were to have our good\\nmeal at the hut, the latter in case we were hung up. Travelling over the\\nsea-ice as far as the Gap, from which we saw that the open sea reached to\\nHut Point, we made our way into the hut, and there was a mystery. The\\naccumulations of ice which we found in it were dug away: there was a\\nnotice outside dated February 8 saying, \\"mail for Captain Scott is in bag\\ninside south door.\\" We hunted everywhere, but there was no Atkinson nor\\nCrean, nor mail, nor the things which the ship was to have brought. All\\nkinds of wild theories were advanced. By the presence of a fresh onion\\nand some bread it was clear that the ship\'s party had been there, but the\\nrest was utterly vague. It was then suggested that we were expected back\\nabout this time, and that the missing men had been sledging to Safety\\nCamp round Cape Armitage on the very shaky sea-ice while we passed them\\nas we came through the Gap. Sledge tracks were found leading on to the\\nsea-ice: we started back in doubt. Scott was terribly anxious, we were\\nall tired, and the dep\xf4t never seemed to come nearer. It was not until we\\nwere some two hundred yards from it that we saw the extra tent. \\"Thank\\nGod!\\" I heard Scott mutter under his breath, and \\"I believe you were even\\nmore anxious than I was, Bill.\\"\\nAtkinson had the ship\'s mail, signed by Campbell. \\"Every incident of the\\nday,\\" Scott wrote, \\"pales before the startling contents of the mail-bag\\nwhich Atkinson gave me--a letter from Campbell setting out his doings and\\nthe finding of Amundsen established in the Bay of Whales.\\"\\n[Illustration: HUT POINT--E.

For an hour or so we were\\nfuriously angry, and were possessed with an insane sense that we must go\\nstraight to the Bay of Whales and have it out with Amundsen and his\\nmen in some undefined fashion or other there and then. Such a mood could\\nnot and did not bear a moment\'s reflection; but it was natural enough. We\\nhad just paid the first instalment of the heart-breaking labour of making\\na path to the Pole; and we felt, however unreasonably, that we had earned\\nthe first right of way.

I\\ndo not defend our burst of rage--for such it was--I simply record it as\\nan integral human part of my narrative. It passed harmlessly; and Scott\'s\\naccount proceeds as follows:\\n\\"One thing only fixes itself definitely in my mind. The proper, as well\\nas the wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not\\nhappened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country\\nwithout fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen\'s plan is a very\\nserious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60\\nmiles--I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice.\\nHis plan of running them seems excellent. But, above and beyond all, he\\ncan start his journey early in the season--an impossible condition with\\nponies.\\"[118]\\nWe read that on leaving McMurdo Sound the Terra Nova coasted eastward\\nalong the Barrier face, with Campbell and his men who were to be landed\\non King Edward VII.\'s Land if possible. She surveyed the face of the\\nBarrier as she went from Cape Crozier to longitude 170\xb0 W., whence she\\nshaped a course direct for Cape Colbeck, which Priestley states in his\\ndiary \\"is only 200 feet high according to our measurement and looks\\nuncommonly like common or garden Barrier.\\"\\nHere they met heavy pack, and were forced to return without finding any\\nplace where the cliff was low enough to allow Campbell and his five men\\nto land. They coasted back, making for an inlet known as Balloon Bight.\\nPriestley tells the story:\\n\\"February 1, 1911. Our trip has not been without outcome after all, and\\nall our doubts about wintering here or in South Victoria Land have been\\nsettled in a startling fashion. About ten o\'clock we steamed into a deep\\nbay in the Barrier which proved to be Shackleton\'s Bay of Whales, and our\\nobservations in the last expedition [Shackleton\'s] have been wonderfully\\nupheld. Our present sights and angles Pennell tells me are almost a\\nduplicate of those that we got. Every one has always been doubtful about\\nthe Bay of Whales we reported, but now the matter has been set at rest\\nfinally. There is no doubt now that Balloon Bight and the neighbouring\\nbay marked on the Discovery\'s chart have become merged into one, and\\nfurther, that since that period the resulting bight has broken back\\nconsiderably more: indeed it seems to have altered a good deal on its\\nwestern border since our visit to it in 1908. Otherwise it is the same,\\nthe same deceptive caves and shadows having from a distance the\\nappearance of rock exposures, the same pressure-ridged cliffs, the same\\nundulations behind, the same expanse of sea-ice and even the same crowds\\nof whales. I hope that before we leave we shall find it possible to\\nsurvey the bight, but that depends on the weather. It was satisfactory to\\nfind all our observations coming right and everybody backing up\\nShackleton, and I turned in last night feeling quite cheerful and\\nbelieving that there would be a really good chance of the Eastern Party\\nfinding a home on the Barrier here--our last chance of surveying King\\nEdward\'s Land.\\n\\"However, man proposes but God disposes, and I was waked up by Lillie at\\none o\'clock this morning by the astounding news that there was a ship in\\nthe bay at anchor to the sea-ice. All was confusion on board for a few\\nminutes, everybody rushing up on deck with cameras and clothes.\\n\\"It was no false alarm, there she was within a few yards of us, and what\\nis more, those of us who had read Nansen\'s books recognized the Fram.\\n\\"She is rigged with fore and aft sails and as she has petrol engines she\\nhas no funnel. Soon afterwards the men forward declared that they sighted\\na hut on the Barrier, and the more excited declared that there was a\\nparty coming out to meet us. Campbell, Levick, and myself were therefore\\nlowered over the side of the ship while she was being made fast, and set\\noff on ski towards the dark spot we could see. This proved to be only an\\nabandoned dep\xf4t and we returned to the ship, where Campbell, who in his\\nanxiety to be the first to meet them had left us beginners far behind,\\nhad opened up conversation with the night watchman.\\n\\"He informed us that there were only three men on board and that the\\nremainder of them were settling Amundsen in winter quarters about as far\\nfrom the dep\xf4t as the dep\xf4t was from the ship. Amundsen is coming to\\nvisit the Fram to-morrow, and we are staying long enough to allow Pennell\\nand Campbell to interview him. They reached the pack about January 6 and\\nwere through it by the 12th, so they did not have as bad a time as we\\ndid. They inform us that Amundsen does not intend to make his descent on\\nthe Pole until next year. This is encouraging as it means a fair race for\\nthe next summer, though the news we are bringing to them will keep the\\nWestern [Main] Party on tenterhooks of excitement all the winter.\\n\\"Our plans have of course been decided for us. We cannot according to\\netiquette trench on their winter quarters, but must return to McMurdo\\nSound and then go off towards Robertson Bay and settle ourselves as best\\nwe can. While we are waiting events we have not been by any means idle.\\nRennick got a sounding, 180 fathoms, and the crew have killed three\\nseals, including one beautiful silver crab-eater, Lillie has secured\\nwater samples at 50, 100, 150, and 170 fathoms and has had a haul with\\nthe plankton net, and Williams is endeavouring to fit up the trawl for a\\nhaul to-morrow if we get time and appropriate weather. I got a roll of\\nfilms and gave the roll to Drake to take home and get developed in\\nChristchurch. There are photographs of the Fram, of the Fram and Terra\\nNova together, of their dep\xf4t, and of the ice-cliffs and the sea-ice\\nwhich is decidedly overcut, the thick snow having been removed in places\\nby the swell until a ledge several yards wide is lying just submerged.\\n\\"It has been calm all the night with the snow falling at intervals.\\n\\"February 4, 1911. I was waked at seven o\'clock this morning by Levick\\ndemanding the loan of my camera. It appears that Amundsen, Johansen and\\nsix men had arrived at the Fram this morning at about 6.30 A.M., and had\\ncome over to interview Campbell and Pennell. Campbell, Pennell and Levick\\nthen went back to breakfast with them and stayed until nearly noon when\\nthey returned telling us to expect Amundsen, Nilsen, the first lieutenant\\nof the Fram who is taking her back after landing the party, and a young\\nlieutenant whose name none of us caught, to lunch. After lunch a party of\\nofficers and men went to see the rest of the Norwegians, see over the\\nship, and say good-bye. I did not go and was able to show Lieut. Jensen\\nover the ship in the meantime. About three o\'clock we let go the ice\\nanchor and parted from the Fram, steaming along the ice very slowly in\\norder to dredge from 190 to 300 fathoms. The haul was successful, about\\ntwo bucketsful of the muddy bottom being secured, and a still more\\nvaluable catch from the biological point of view were two long crinoids,\\nabout a couple of feet in length and in fairly perfect condition, which\\nhad become attached to the outside of the net.\\n\\"We are now standing along the Barrier continuing our survey to the bight\\nwe first struck, after which we sail to Cape Evans, stay a day there and\\nthen make up North to try and effect a lodgment on the coast beyond Cape\\nAdare.\\n\\"During the morning Browning and I examined the ice-face forming the\\neastern face of the bight. We found it to be made of clear ice of grain\\nfrom a quarter to three-eighths of an inch in size and full of bubbles.\\n\\"On the way there I took a couple of photographs of some of Amundsen\'s\\ndogs, and when we were there I got a few of crevasses and caves in the\\nBarrier face.\\n\\"Well! we have left the Norwegians and our thoughts are full, too full,\\nof them at present. The impression they have left with me is that of a\\nset of men of distinctive personality, hard, and evidently inured to\\nhardship, good goers and pleasant and good-humoured. All these qualities\\ncombine to make them very dangerous rivals, but even did one want not to,\\none cannot help liking them individually in spite of the rivalry.\\n\\"One thing I have particularly noticed is the way in which they are\\nrefraining from getting information from us which might be useful to\\nthem. We have news which will make the Western Party as uneasy as\\nourselves and the world will watch with interest a race for the Pole next\\nyear, a race which may go any way, and may be decided by luck or by\\ndogged energy and perseverance on either side.","image":"C05.07.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.08","output":"The Norwegians are facing danger as the ice is breaking rapidly from the Bay of Whales, but they are prepared for the journey with experienced snow travel and unlimited dogs.

On the other hand if they get through the winter safely\\n(and they are aware of their danger), they have unlimited dogs, the\\nenergy of a nation as northern as ourselves, and experience with\\nsnow-travelling that could be beaten by no collection of men in the\\nworld.\\n\\"There remains the Beardmore Glacier.

One thing I feel and that is that our Southern\\nParty will go far before they permit themselves to be beaten by any one,\\nand I think that two parties are very likely to reach the Pole next year,\\nbut God only knows which will get there first.\\n\\"A few of the things we learnt about the Norwegians are as follows:\\n\\"The engines of the Fram occupy only half the size of our wardroom, the\\npetrol tanks have not needed replenishment since they left Norway, and\\ntheir propeller can be lifted by three men. They kept fresh potatoes from\\nNorway to the Barrier. (Some of them must surely be renegade Irishmen.)\\nThey have each a separate cabin \'tween-decks in the Fram, and are very\\ncomfortable. They are using for transporting their stores to the hut,\\neight teams of five dogs each, working every alternate day.\\n\\"They intend to use for the Polar Journey teams of ten dogs, each team\\nworking one day out of two. Their dogs stop at a whistle, and if they\\nmake a break they can be stopped by overturning the sledge, empty or full\\nas the case may be. They are nine in the shore party and ten in the ship.\\nTheir ship is going back to Buenos Ayres with Nilsen in charge and during\\nthe winter is to encircle the world, sounding all the way.\\n\\"They are not starting on the dash South this year and do not yet know\\nwhether they will lay dep\xf4ts this year. They have 116 dogs and ten of\\nthese are bitches, so that they can rear pups, and have done so very\\nsuccessfully on the way out. The Fram acts like a cork in the sea; she\\nrolls tremendously but does not ship water, and during the voyage they\\nhave had the dogs running loose about the decks. There is a lot more\\nmiscellaneous information, but I may remember it more coherently a little\\nlater when the main impressions of the rencontre are a little more\\nfaint.\\"[119]\\nIt will be seen that Priestley missed three points. First, he was left\\nwith a conventional but very erroneous impression of Amundsen as a blunt\\nNorwegian sailor, not in the least an intellectual. Second, he thought\\nAmundsen had camped on the ice and not on terra firma. Third, he thought\\nAmundsen was going to the Pole by the old route over the Beardmore. The\\ntruth was that Amundsen was an explorer of the markedly intellectual\\ntype, rather Jewish than Scandinavian, who had proved his sagacity by\\ndiscovering solid footing for the winter by pure judgment. For the\\nmoment, let it be confessed, we all underrated Amundsen, and could not\\nshake off the feeling that he had stolen a march on us.\\nBack to McMurdo Sound, and the news left at Hut Point. Then the two\\nponies which had been allotted to Campbell were swum ashore at Cape\\nEvans, since he thought that now they would be of more use to Scott than\\nto himself. Subsequent events proved the extreme usefulness of this\\nunselfish act. The Terra Nova would steam north and try and land\\nCampbell\'s party on the extreme northern shores of Queen Victoria Land.\\nAt the same time there was so little coal left that it might be necessary\\nto go straight back to New Zealand. Campbell regretted not being able to\\nsee Scott, supposing that the altered circumstances caused Scott to wish\\nto rearrange his parties, and also because Amundsen had asked Campbell to\\nland his party at the Bay of Whales, giving him the area to the east to\\nexplore, and Campbell did not wish to accept before getting Scott\'s\\npermission.\\nAs we know now coal ran so short that it came to an alternative of\\ndumping Campbell, his men and gear hastily on the beach at Cape Adare, or\\ntaking them back to New Zealand. As one member of the crew said:\\n\\"Exploring is all very well in its way, but it is a thing which can be\\nvery easily overdone.\\" The ship was as ready to get rid of them as they\\nwere to get rid of the ship. They were landed, working to their waists in\\nthe surf, and the ship got safely back to New Zealand.\\nScott decided that the period of waiting until the pony party arrived\\nfrom One Ton should be employed in sledging stores out to Corner Camp.\\nBut the dog-teams were done, \\"the dogs are thin as rakes; they are\\nravenous and very tired. I feel this should not be, and that it is\\nevident that they are underfed. The ration must be increased next year\\nand we must have some properly-thought-out diet. The biscuit alone is not\\ngood enough.\\"[120] In addition, several dogs were feeling the effects of\\ninjuries due to the crevasse incident. There remained the men and the one\\npony which had survived out of the three sent back from Bluff Dep\xf4t,\\nnamely Jimmy Pigg.\\nThe party started on Friday, February 24, marching by day. It consisted\\nof Scott, Crean and myself with one sledge and tent, Lieutenant Evans,\\nAtkinson and Forde with a second sledge and tent, and Keohane leading\\nJames Pigg. On the second night out we saw the pony party pass us in the\\ndistance on their way to Safety Camp.[121] At Corner Camp Scott decided\\nto leave Lieutenant Evans\' party to come in with the pony more slowly,\\nand himself to push on with Crean and myself at top speed for Safety\\nCamp. We made a forced march well into the night, doing twenty-six miles\\nfor the day, and camped some ten miles from Safety Camp, where the pony\\nparty must by this time have arrived.\\nThe events which followed were disastrous, and the steps which led to a\\ncatastrophe which entailed the loss of much of our best transport, and\\nonly by a miracle did not lead to the loss of several lives, were\\ncomplicated. At this moment, the night of February 26, there were three\\nparties on the Barrier. Behind Scott was Lieutenant Evans\' party and the\\npony, James Pigg. Scott himself was camped within easy marching distance\\nof Safety Camp with Crean and myself. At Safety Camp were the two\\ndog-teams with Wilson and Meares, while the pony party from One Ton Dep\xf4t\\nhad just arrived with five ponies which were for the most part thin,\\nhungry and worn. Between Safety Camp and Hut Point lay the frozen sea,\\nwhich might or might not break up this year, but we knew from our\\nobservations a few days before that the ice was in a shaky condition. At\\nthat time the ice sheet extended some seven miles to the north of Hut\\nPoint. The season was fast closing in: temperatures of fifty or sixty\\ndegrees of frost had been common for the last fortnight, and this was bad\\nfor the ponies. We had been unfortunate in having several severe\\nblizzards, and it was already clear that it was these autumn blizzards\\nmore than cold temperatures and soft surfaces which the ponies could not\\nendure. Scott was most anxious to get the animals into such shelter as we\\ncould make for them at Hut Point.\\nThe next morning, February 27, we woke to a regular cold autumn\\nblizzard--very thick, wind force 9 and temperature about minus twenty.\\nThis was disheartening, and indeed with our six worn ponies still on the\\nBarrier the outlook for them was discouraging. The blizzard came to an\\nend the next morning. Scott must take up the first part of that day\'s\\nstory:\\n\\"Packed up at 6 A.M. and marched into Safety Camp. Found every one very\\ncold and depressed. Wilson and Meares had had continuous bad weather\\nsince we left, Bowers and Oates since their arrival. The blizzard had\\nraged for two days. The animals looked in a sorry condition, but all were\\nalive. The wind blew keen and cold from the east. There could be no\\nadvantage in waiting here, and soon all arrangements were made for a\\ngeneral shift to Hut Point. Packing took a long time. The snowfall had\\nbeen prodigious, and parts of the sledges were 3 or 4 feet under drift.\\nAbout 4 o\'clock the two dog-teams got safely away. Then the pony party\\nprepared to go. As the cloths were stript from the ponies the ravages of\\nthe blizzard became evident. The animals, without exception, were\\nterribly emaciated, and Weary Willie was in a pitiable condition.\\n\\"The plan was for the ponies to follow the dog tracks, our small party to\\nstart last and get in front of the ponies on the sea-ice. I was very\\nanxious about the sea-ice passage owing to the spread of the water\\nholes.\\"[122]\\nThe two dog-teams left with Meares and Wilson some time before the\\nponies, and for the moment they go out of this story.\\nBowers\' pony, Uncle Bill, was ready first, and he started with him. We\\ngot three more ponies harnessed, Punch, Nobby and Guts, and tried to\\nharness Weary Willie, but when we attempted to lead him forward he\\nimmediately fell down.","image":"C05.08.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.09","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The explorers attempt to save a sick pony but fail, and have trouble navigating the sea ice with their sledges and ponies.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_1\\": \\"We had four pretty heavy sledges, as we were taking six weeks\' man food and oil to the hut, as well as a lot of gear from the dep\xf4t, and pony food, etc. Unfortunately the dogs misunderstood their orders and, instead of piloting us, dashed off on their own.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_2\\": \\"We were in the middle of a floating pack of broken-up ice.

He sent Crean and me forward with the three\\nbetter ponies to join Bowers, now waiting a mile ahead. Oates and Gran he\\nkept with himself, to try and help the sick pony. His diary tells how \\"we\\nmade desperate efforts to save the poor creature, got him once more on\\nhis legs, gave him a hot oat mash. Then, after a wait of an hour, Oates\\nled him off, and we packed the sledge and followed on ski; 500 yards from\\nthe camp the poor creature fell again and I felt it was the last effort.\\nWe camped, built a snow wall round him, and did all we possibly could to\\nget him on his feet.

It makes a late start necessary for next year.\\n\\"Well, we have done our best and bought our experience at a heavy cost.\\nNow every effort must be bent on saving the remaining animals.\\"[123]\\nA letter from Bowers home, which certainly does not overstate the\\nadventures of himself and the two men sent forward to join him, is\\nprobably the best description of the incidents which followed. It will be\\nremembered that Crean and I with three ponies were sent from Safety Camp\\nto join him: he was already leading one pony. Night was beginning to\\nfall, and the light was bad, but from the edge of the Barrier the two\\ndog-teams could still be seen as black dots in the distance towards Cape\\nArmitage.\\n\\"On the night of February 28 I led off with my pony and was surprised at\\nthe delay in the others leaving--knowing nothing of Weary\'s collapse.\\nOver the edge of the Barrier I went, and at the bottom of the snow\\nincline awaited the others. To my surprise Cherry and Crean appeared with\\nPunch, Nobby and Guts in a string, and then I heard the reason for Oates\\nand Scott not having come on. My orders were to push on to Hut Point over\\nthe sea-ice without delay, and to follow the dogs; previously I had been\\ntold to camp on the sea-ice only in case of the beasts being unable to go\\non. We had four pretty heavy sledges, as we were taking six weeks\' man\\nfood and oil to the hut, as well as a lot of gear from the dep\xf4t, and\\npony food, etc. Unfortunately the dogs misunderstood their orders and,\\ninstead of piloting us, dashed off on their own. We saw them like specks\\nin the distance in the direction of the old seal crack. Having crossed\\nthis they wheeled to the right in the direction of Cape Armitage and\\ndisappeared into a black indefinite mist, which seemed to pervade\\neverything in that direction. We heard afterwards that in a mile or two\\nthey came to some alarming signs and, turning, made for the Gap where\\nthey got up on to the land about midnight.\\n\\"I plugged on in their tracks, till we came to the seal crack which was\\nan old pressure-ridge running many miles S.W. from Pram Point. We\\nconsidered the ice behind this crack--over which we had just come--fast\\nice; it was older ice than that beyond, as it had undoubtedly frozen over\\nfirst. Having crossed the crack we streaked on for Cape Armitage. The\\nanimals were going badly, owing to the effects of the blizzard, and\\nfrequent stoppages were necessary. On coming to some shaky ice we headed\\nfarther west as there were always some bad places off the cape, and I\\nthought it better to make a good circuit. Crean, who had been over the\\nice recently, told me it was all right farther round. However, about a\\nmile farther on I began to have misgivings; the cracks became too\\nfrequent to be pleasant, and although the ice was from five to ten feet\\nthick, one does not like to see water squelching between them, as we did\\nlater. It spells motion, and motion on sea-ice means breakage. I shoved\\non in the hope of getting on better ice round the cape, but at last came\\na moving crack, and that decided me to turn back. We could see nothing\\nowing to the black mist, everything looked solid as ever, but I knew\\nenough to mistrust moving ice, however solid it seemed. It was a beastly\\nmarch back: dark, gloomy and depressing. The beasts got more and more\\ndown in their spirits and stopped so frequently that I thought we would\\nnever reach the seal crack. I said to Cherry, however, that I would take\\nno risks, and camp well over the other side on the old sound ice if we\\ncould get there. This we managed to do eventually. Here there was soft\\nsnow, whereas on the sea side of the crack it was hard: that is the\\nreason we lost the dogs\' tracks at once on crossing. Even over this crack\\nI thought it best to march as far in as possible. We got well into the\\nbay, as far as our exhausted ponies would drag, before I camped and\\nthrew up the walls, fed the beasts, and retired to feed ourselves. We had\\nonly the primus with the missing cap and it took over 1\xbd hours to heat up\\nthe water; however, we had a cup of pemmican. It was very dark, and I\\nmistook a small bag of curry powder for the cocoa bag, and made cocoa\\nwith that, mixed with sugar; Crean drank his right down before\\ndiscovering anything was wrong. It was 2 P.M. before we were ready to\\nturn in. I went out and saw everything quiet: the mist still hung to the\\nwest, but you could see a good mile and all was still. The sky was very\\ndark over the Strait though, the unmistakable sign of open water. I\\nturned in. Two and a half hours later I awoke, hearing a noise. Both my\\ncompanions were snoring, I thought it was that and was on the point of\\nturning in again having seen that it was only 4.30, when I heard the\\nnoise again. I thought--\'my pony is at the oats!\' and went out.\\n\\"I cannot describe either the scene or my feelings. I must leave those to\\nyour imagination. We were in the middle of a floating pack of broken-up\\nice. The tops of the hills were visible, but all below was thin mist and\\nas far as the eye could see there was nothing solid; it was all broken\\nup, and heaving up and down with the swell. Long black tongues of water\\nwere everywhere. The floe on which we were had split right under our\\npicketing line, and cut poor Guts\' wall in half. Guts himself had gone,\\nand a dark streak of water alone showed the place where the ice had\\nopened under him. The two sledges securing the other end of the line were\\non the next floe and had been pulled right to the edge. Our camp was on a\\nfloe not more than 30 yards across. I shouted to Cherry and Crean, and\\nrushed out in my socks to save the two sledges; the two floes were\\ntouching farther on and I dragged them to this place and got them on to\\nour floe. At that moment our own floe split in two, but we were all\\ntogether on one piece. I then got my finnesko on, remarking that we had\\nbeen in a few tight places, but this was about the limit. I have been\\ntold since that I was quixotic not to leave everything and make for\\nsafety. You will understand, however, that I never for one moment\\nconsidered the abandonment of anything.\\n\\"We packed up camp and harnessed up our ponies in remarkably quick time.\\nWhen ready to move I had to decide which way to go. Obviously towards\\nCape Armitage was impossible, and to the eastward also, as the wind was\\nfrom that direction, and we were already floating west towards the open\\nsound. Our only hope lay to the south, and thither I went. We found the\\nponies would jump the intervals well. At least Punch would and the other\\ntwo would follow him. My idea was never to separate, but to get\\neverything on to one floe at a time; and then wait till it touched or\\nnearly touched another in the right direction, and then jump the ponies\\nover and drag the four sledges across ourselves. In this way we made\\nslow, but sure progress. While one was acting all was well, the waiting\\nfor a lead to close was the worst trial. Sometimes it would take 10\\nminutes or more, but there was so much motion in the ice that sooner or\\nlater bump you would go against another piece, and then it was up and\\nover. Sometimes they split, sometimes they bounced back so quickly that\\nonly one horse could get over, and then we had to wait again. We had to\\nmake frequent detours and were moving west all the time with the pack,\\nstill we were getting south, too.","image":"C05.09.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.10","output":"{\\n  \\"summary\\": \\"The group encounters killer whales and precarious ice conditions while traveling towards the Barrier.

Crean like most bluejackets behaved as if he had\\ndone this sort of thing often before. Cherry, the practical, after an\\nhour or two dug out some chocolate and biscuit, during one of our\\nenforced waits, and distributed it. I felt at that time that food was the\\nlast thing on earth I wanted, and put it in my pocket; in less than half\\nan hour, though, I had eaten the lot. The ponies behaved as well as my\\ncompanions, and jumped the floes in great style. After getting them on a\\nnew floe we simply left them, and there they stood chewing at each\\nothers\' head ropes or harness till we were over with the sledges and\\nready to take them on again. Their implicit trust in us was touching to\\nbehold. A 12-feet sledge makes an excellent bridge if an opening is too\\nwide to jump. After some hours we saw fast ice ahead, and thanked God for\\nit. Meanwhile a further unpleasantness occurred in the arrival of a host\\nof the terrible \'killer\' whales. These were reaping a harvest of seal in\\nthe broken-up ice, and cruised among the floes with their immense black\\nfins sticking up, and blowing with a terrific roar. The Killer is\\nscientifically known as the Orca, and, though far smaller than the sperm\\nand other large whales, is a much more dangerous animal. He is armed with\\na huge iron jaw and great blunt socket teeth. Killers act in concert,\\ntoo, and, as you may remember, nearly got Ponting when we were unloading\\nthe ship, by pressing up the thin ice from beneath and splitting it in\\nall directions.\\n\\"It took us over six hours to get close to the fast ice, which proved to\\nbe the Barrier, some immense chunks of which we actually saw break off\\nand join the pack. Close in, the motion was less owing to the jambing up\\nof the ice somewhere farther west. We had only just cleared the Strait in\\ntime though, as all the ice in the centre, released beyond Cape Armitage,\\nheaded off into the middle of the Strait, and thence to the Ross Sea. Our\\nspirits rose as we neared the Barrier edge, and I made for a big sloping\\nfloe which I expected would be touching; at any rate I anticipated no\\ndifficulty. We rushed up the slope towards safety, and were little\\nprepared for the scene that met our eyes at the top. All along the\\nBarrier face a broad lane of water from thirty to forty feet wide\\nextended. This was filled with smashed-up brash ice, which was heaving up\\nand down to the swell like the contents of a cauldron. Killers were\\ncruising there with fiendish activity, and the Barrier edge was a sheer\\ncliff of ice on the other side fifteen to twenty feet high. It was a case\\nof so near and yet so far. Suddenly our great sloping floe calved in two,\\nso we beat a hasty retreat. I selected a sound-looking floe just clear of\\nthis turmoil, that was at least ten feet thick, and fairly rounded, with\\na flat surface. Here we collected everything and having done all that man\\ncould do, we fed the beasts and took counsel.\\n\\"Cherry and Crean both volunteered to do anything, in the spirit they had\\nshown right through. It appeared of first necessity to communicate with\\nCaptain Scott. I guessed his anxiety on our behalf, and, as we could do\\nnothing more, we wanted help of some sort. It occurred to me that a man\\nworking up to windward along the Barrier face might happen upon a floe\\ntouching [the Barrier]. It was obviously impossible to take ponies up\\nthere anywhere, but an active man might wait his opportunity. Going to\\nwindward, too, he could always retreat on to our floe, as the ice was\\nbeing pushed together in our direction. The next consideration was, whom\\nto send. To go myself was out of the question. The problem was whether to\\nsend one, or both, my companions. As my object was to save the animals\\nand gear, it appeared to me that one man remaining would be helpless in\\nthe event of the floe splitting up, as he would be busy saving himself. I\\ntherefore decided to send one only. This would have to be Crean, as\\nCherry, who wears glasses, could not see so well. Both volunteered, but\\nas I say, I thought out all the pros and cons and sent Crean, knowing\\nthat, at the worst, he could get back to us at any time. I sent a note to\\nCaptain Scott, and, stuffing Crean\'s pockets with food, we saw him\\ndepart.\\n\\"Practical Cherry suggested pitching the tent as a mark of our\\nwhereabouts, and having done this I mounted the theodolite to watch Crean\\nthrough the telescope. The rise and fall of the floe made this difficult,\\nespecially as a number of Emperor penguins came up and looked just like\\nmen in the distance. Fortunately the sunlight cleared the frost smoke,\\nand as it fell calm our westerly motion began to decrease. The swell\\nstarted to go down. Outside us in the centre of the Strait all the ice\\nhad gone out, and open water remained. We were one of a line of loose\\nfloes floating near the Barrier edge. Crean was hours moving to and fro\\nbefore I had the satisfaction of seeing him up on the Barrier. I said:\\n\'Thank God one of us is out of the wood, anyhow.\'\\n\\"It was not a pleasant day that Cherry and I spent all alone there,\\nknowing as we did that it only wanted a zephyr from the south to send us\\nirretrievably out to sea; still there is satisfaction in knowing that one\\nhas done one\'s utmost, and I felt that having been delivered so\\nwonderfully so far, the same Hand would not forsake us at the last.\\n\\"We gave the ponies all they could eat that day. The Killers were too\\ninterested in us to be pleasant. They had a habit of bobbing up and down\\nperpendicularly, so as to see over the edge of a floe, in looking for\\nseals. The huge black and yellow heads with sickening pig eyes only a few\\nyards from us at times, and always around us, are among the most\\ndisconcerting recollections I have of that day. The immense fins were bad\\nenough, but when they started a perpendicular dodge they were positively\\nbeastly. As the day wore on skua gulls, looking upon us as certain\\ncarrion, settled down comfortably near us to await developments. The\\nswell, however, was getting less and less and it resolved itself into a\\nquestion of speed, as to whether the wind or Captain Scott would reach us\\nfirst.\\n\\"Crean had got up into the Barrier at great risks to himself as I\\ngathered afterwards from his very modest account. He had reached Captain\\nScott some time after his [Scott\'s] meeting with Wilson.[124] I heard\\nthat at the time Captain Scott was very angry with me for not abandoning\\neverything and getting away safely myself. For my own part I must say\\nthat the abandoning of the ponies was the one thing that had never\\nentered my head. It was a long way round, but at 7 P.M. he arrived at the\\nedge of the Barrier opposite us with Oates and Crean. Everything was\\nstill, and Cherry and I could have got on safe ice at any time during the\\nlast half hour by using the sledge as a ladder. A big overturned fragment\\nhad jambed in the lane, between a high floe and the Barrier edge, and,\\nthere being no wind, it remained there. However, there was the\\nconsideration of the ponies, so we waited.\\n\\"Scott, instead of blowing me up, was too relieved at our safety to be\\nanything but pleased. I said: \'What about the ponies and the sledges?\' He\\nsaid: \'I don\'t care a damn about the ponies and sledges. It\'s you I want,\\nand I am going to see you safe here up on the Barrier before I do\\nanything else.\' Cherry and I had got everything ready, so, dragging up\\ntwo sledges, we dumped the gear off them, and using them as ladders, one\\ndown from the berg on to the buffer piece of ice, and the other up to the\\ntop of the Barrier, we got up without difficulty. Captain Scott was so\\npleased, that I realized the feeling he must have had all day. He had\\nbeen blaming himself for our deaths, and here we were very much alive. He\\nsaid: \'My dear chaps, you can\'t think how glad I am to see you\\nsafe--Cherry likewise.\'\\n\\"I was all for saving the beasts and sledges, however, so he let us go\\nback and haul the sledges on to the nearest floe. We did this one by one\\nand brought the ponies along, while Titus dug down a slope from the\\nBarrier edge in the hope of getting the ponies up it. Scott knew more\\nabout ice than any of us, and realizing the danger we didn\'t, still\\nwanted to abandon things. I fought for my point tooth and nail, and got\\nhim to concede one article and then another, and still the ice did not\\nmove till we had thrown and hauled up every article on to the Barrier\\nexcept the two ladders and the ponies.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\"To my intense disappointment at this juncture the ice started to move\\nagain. Titus had been digging down a road in the Barrier edge, and I\\nhoped to dig down a similar slope from the floe, the snow thus shovelled\\ndown would go over the blue ice chunk, cover up the slippery ice and\\nlevel it up. It would have taken hours, but was the only chance of\\ngetting the animals up. We dug like fury until Captain Scott peremptorily\\nordered us up. I ran up on the floe and took the nosebags off the ponies\\nbefore we got on to the Barrier, and hauled the sledges up. It was only\\njust in time. There was the faintest south-easterly air, but, like a\\nblack snake, the lane of water stretched between the ponies and\\nourselves. It widened almost imperceptibly, 2 feet, 6 feet, 10 feet, 20\\nfeet, and, sick as we were about the ponies, we were glad to be on the\\nsafe side of that.","image":"C05.10.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.11","output":"1.

While supper (it was about 3 A.M.) was being cooked,\\nScott and I walked down again. The wind had gone to the east, and all the\\nice was under weigh. A lane 70 feet wide extended along the Barrier edge,\\nand Killers were chasing up and down it like racehorses. Our three\\nunfortunate beasts were some way out, sailing parallel to the Barrier. We\\nreturned, and if ever one could feel miserable I did then. My feelings\\nwere nothing to what poor Captain Scott had had to endure that day. I at\\nonce broached the hopeful side of the subject, remarking that, with the\\ntwo Campbell had left, we had ten ponies at Winter quarters. He said,\\nhowever, that he had no confidence whatever in the motors after the way\\ntheir rollers had become messed up unloading the ship. He had had his\\nconfidence in the dogs much shaken on the return journey, and now he had\\nlost the most solid asset--the best of his pony transport. He said: \'Of\\ncourse we shall have a run for our money next season, but as far as the\\nPole is concerned I have but very little hope.\' We had a mournful meal,\\nbut after the others turned in I went down again, and by striking across\\ndiagonally came abreast of the ponies\' floe, over a mile away. They were\\nmoving west fast, but they saw me, and remained huddled together not the\\nleast disturbed, or doubting that we would bring them their breakfast\\nnosebags as usual in the morning. Poor trustful creatures! If I could\\nhave done it then, I would gladly have killed them rather than picture\\nthem starving on that floe out on the Ross Sea, or eaten by the exultant\\nKillers that cruised around.\\n\\"After breakfast Captain Scott sent me to bring up the sledges. It was\\ndead calm again. Hope always springs, so I took his pair of glasses and\\nlooked west from the Barrier edge. Nearly all the ice had gone, but a\\nmedley of floes had been hurled up against a long point of Barrier much\\nfarther west. To my delight I saw three green specks on one of these--the\\npony rugs--and all four of us legged it back to the tent to tell Captain\\nScott. We were soon off over the Barrier. It was a long way, but we had a\\ntent and some food. Crean had a bad day of snow-blindness, and could see\\nabsolutely nothing. So, on arrival at the place, we pitched the tent and\\nleft him there. The ponies were in a much worse place than the day\\nbefore, but the ice was still there, and some floes actually touched the\\nBarrier.\\n\\"After our recent experience Captain Scott would only let us go on\\ncondition that as soon as he gave the order we were to drop everything\\nand run for the Barrier. I was in a feverish hurry, and with Titus and\\nCherry selected a possible route over about six floes, and some low brash\\nice. The hardest jump was the first one, but it was nothing to what they\\nhad done the day before, so we put Punch at it. Why he hung fire I cannot\\nthink,[125] but he did, at the very edge, and the next moment was in the\\nwater. I will draw a veil over our struggle to get the plucky little pony\\nout. We could not manage it, and Titus had at last to put an end to his\\nstruggles with a pick.\\n\\"There was now my pony and Nobby. We abandoned that route, while Captain\\nScott looked out another and longer one by going right out on the\\nsea-floes. This we decided on, if we could get the animals off their\\npresent floe, which necessitated a good jump on any side. Captain Scott\\nsaid he would have no repetition of Punch\'s misfortune if he could help\\nit. He would rather kill them on the floe. Anyhow, we rushed old Nobby at\\nthe jump, but he refused. It seemed no good, but I rushed him at it again\\nand again. Scott was for killing them [it should be remembered that this\\nice, with the men on it, might drift away from the Barrier at any moment,\\nand then there might be no further chance of saving the men] but I was\\nnot, and, pretending not to hear him, I rushed the old beast again. He\\ncleared it beautifully, and Titus, seizing the opportunity, ran my pony\\nat it with similar success. We then returned to the Barrier and worked\\nalong westward till a suitable place for getting up was found. There\\nScott and Cherry started digging a road, while Titus and I went out via\\nthe sea-ice to get the ponies. We had an empty sledge as a bridge or\\nladder, in case of emergency, and had to negotiate about forty floes to\\nreach the animals. It was pretty easy going, though, and we brought them\\nalong with great success as far as the two nearest floes. At this place\\nthe ice was jambed.\\n\\"Nobby cleared the last jump splendidly, when suddenly in the open water\\npond on one side a school of over a dozen of the terrible whales arose.\\nThis must have flurried my horse just as he was jumping, as instead of\\ngoing straight he jumped [sideways] and just missed the floe with his\\nhind legs. It was another horrible situation, but Scott rushed Nobby up\\non the Barrier, while Titus, Cherry and I struggled with poor old Uncle\\nBill. Why the whales did not come under the ice and attack him I cannot\\nsay--perhaps they were full of seal, perhaps they were so engaged in\\nlooking at us on the top of the floe that they forgot to look below;\\nanyhow, we got him safely as far as [the bottom of the Barrier cliff],\\npulling him through the thin ice towards a low patch of brash.\\n\\"Captain Scott was afraid of something happening to us with those\\ndevilish whales so close, and was for abandoning the horse right away. I\\nhad no eyes or ears for anything but the horse just then, and getting on\\nto the thin brash ice got the Alpine rope fast to each of the pony\'s\\nforefeet. Crean was too blind to do anything but hold the rescued horse\\non the Barrier, but the other four of us pulled might and main till we\\ngot the old horse out and lying on his side. The brash ice was so thin\\nthat, had a \'Killer\' come up then he would have scattered it, and the lot\\nof us into the water like chaff. I was sick with disappointment when I\\nfound that my horse could not rise. Titus said: \'He\'s done; we shall\\nnever get him up alive.\' The cold water and shock on top of all his\\nrecent troubles, had been too much for the undefeated old sportsman. In\\nvain I tried to get him to his feet; three times he tried and then fell\\nover backwards into the water again. At that moment a new danger arose.\\nThe whole piece of Barrier itself started to subside.\\n\\"It had evidently been broken before, and the tide was doing the rest. We\\nwere ordered up and it certainly was all too necessary; still Titus and I\\nhung over the old Uncle Bill\'s head. I said: \'I can\'t leave him to be\\neaten alive by those whales.\' There was a pick lying up on the floe.\\nTitus said: \'I shall be sick if I have to kill another horse like I did\\nthe last.\' I had no intention that anybody should kill my own horse but\\nmyself, and getting the pick I struck where Titus told me. I made sure of\\nmy job before we ran up and jumped the opening in the Barrier, carrying a\\nblood-stained pick-axe instead of leading the pony I had almost\\nconsidered safe.\\n\\"We returned to our old camp that night (March 2) with Nobby, the only\\none saved of the five that left One Ton Dep\xf4t. I was fearfully cut up\\nabout my pony and Punch, but it was better than last night; we knew they\\nwould not have to starve and that all their troubles were now at an end.\\nBefore supper I went for a walk along the Barrier with Scott, and the\\nnext day we started back. We left one tent, two sledges and a lot of gear\\nas Nobby could only pull two light sledges, and we could not pull an\\nexcessive weight on that bad surface. As it was we had over 800 lbs. on\\nthe sledge when we left. It was a glaring day with the surface soft and\\nsandy, a combination of unpleasant circumstances. It took five hours to\\ndrag as far as the place we had originally gone down on to the sea-ice\\nfrom the Barrier.\\n\\"Evans and his party should now have arrived from Corner Camp, and as\\nCaptain Scott wanted to see if they had left a note at Safety Camp, I\\nwalked up there while the tea was being brewed. It was about 1\xbc miles\\naway, and I found traces of the party in the snow, but no note. It fed me\\nup to see the walls so recently occupied by our ponies, and I was glad to\\nleave. The afternoon march was interminable; it seemed as if we would\\nnever reach the coast. At last we came to the Pram Point Pressure Ridges\\nwhere the Barrier joins the peninsula to eastward of Cape Armitage. They\\nare waves of ice up to 20 feet in height running along parallel to each\\nother with a valley in between each, and are only crevassed badly at the\\nouter end as far as we have seen, though there are smaller crevasses\\nright along. We camped in one of these valleys about 9.30 P.M.; I was\\nthoroughly tired, so I think was everybody else. We were about a mile\\nfrom the ice edge; and the problem was where to get Nobby up the\\nprecipitous slopes. This was solved by the arrival of Evans, Atkinson,\\nForde and Keohane about midnight. They had seen us coming in from the\\nheights, and had come down for news. Teddy Evans had arrived the day\\nbefore, and, being warned off the Barrier edge by a note left by Captain\\nScott, had made for the land with his party, and one horse Jimmy Pigg. He\\nhad found a good way up a mile or so farther east, almost under Castle\\nRock. He had walked to Hut Point with Atkinson the next day and heard of\\nthe loss of Cherry, myself and the animals from Bill Wilson and Meares\\nwho had been left there to look after their teams. I hadn\'t seen Atkinson\\nfor quite a while when we met this time.","image":"C05.11.jpeg"},{"merge":"C05.12","output":"Bowers describes a journey from Safety Camp to Hut Point, encountering steep slopes and treacherous ice.

It was so steep that the pony could\\nonly be led up and we had to put on crampons to grip the ice. These are\\nmerely a sole of leather with light metal plates for foot and heel\\ncontaining spikes. [These were altered afterwards.] They have leather\\nbeckets and a lanyard rove off for making them fast over the finnesko. It\\ntook us all the morning to get everything up to the top and then it\\nstarted to blow. The camp was wonderfully sheltered. Jimmy Pigg and Nobby\\nwere reunited after many weeks, and to show their friendliness the former\\nbit the latter in the back of the neck as a first introduction. Atkinson\\nhad gone to Hut Point to reassure Uncle Bill as to our safety and arrived\\nagain with Gran just as we got the last load up. There was no sugar at\\nthe hut except what the dogs had brought in, so Gran, who was quite\\nfresh, volunteered to get a couple of bags from the dep\xf4t at Safety Camp,\\nwhich could plainly be seen out on the Barrier. We all went to the edge\\nof the slope to see him go down it on ski. He did it splendidly and must\\nhave been going with the speed of an express train down the incline, as\\nhe was on the Barrier in an incredibly short time compared to the hours\\nwe had dragged up the same slope with the loads. Teddy, Titus and Keohane\\nwere left at the camp to be joined by Gran later. Scott started off for\\nHut Point with Crean and Cherry on his sledge, while I followed with\\nForde and Atkinson. The others helped us up several hundred feet of slope\\nand left us under Castle Rock.\\n\\"It was here that they mistook their way in the blizzard and lost a man\\nfrom the Discovery. Though it was fine below it was blowing like anything\\non the heights. I was too busily occupied to see much of the hills and\\nsnow-slopes which I got to know so well later. It was about three miles\\ndirect to the hut, but very up and down hill. At the last, however, you\\nsee the Bay in panorama with Cape Armitage on one side, and Hut Point on\\nthe other, where the Discovery lay two whole years. It is a magnificent\\nview from the heights and for wild desolate grandeur would take some\\nbeating; the Western Mountains and the great dome of Mount Discovery\\nacross the black strait of water, covered with dark frost smoke, and here\\nand there an iceberg driving fast towards the sea. About half a mile\\nbelow us was the little hut and, on the left, the 800-feet pyramid of\\nObservation Hill. It is a perfect chaos of hills and extinct craters just\\nhere.\\n\\"It was blowing like fun. We left one sledge on the top of ski-slope and\\njust took what was necessary on the other, such as our bags, etc. It was\\nmy first experience of steep downhill sledging. Instead of anybody\\npulling forward we all had to hang back and guide the sledge down the\\nslippery incline without letting it take charge or getting upset. It is\\ngreat fun. On reaching the head of the Bay, however, we had quite a\\ndangerous little bit to cross. Here it was swept of snow and there was\\nnothing but glassy ice and the incline ended in a low ice-cliff with the\\nwater below it. Attached as we were to the sledge we should have been at\\na disadvantage had it come to swimming, which a slip might easily have\\nbrought about. We scratched carefully across this and then headed down on\\nthe snow, arriving at the hut all well. The old hut had changed\\ntremendously since I last saw it, having been dug out and cleared of snow\\nand ice. Two unrecognizable sweeps greeted us heartily, they were Bill\\nand Meares; the dogs howled a chorus for our benefit; it was quite like\\ncoming home. Inside the hut, the cause of the blackness was apparent,\\nthey had a blubber fire going, an open one, with no chimney or uptake for\\nthe smoke. After such a long open-air life it fairly choked me, and for\\nonce I could not eat a square meal. We all slept in a row against the\\nwest wall of the hut with our feet inboard.\\n\\"The next morning Captain Scott, Bill, Cherry and I set out to walk to\\nCastle Rock and meet the other party. It was fairly fizzing from the sea,\\nbut clear. Once up on the Heights, however, we seemed to get less wind. A\\ncouple of hours later we were at the great rock, Castle Rock, which is\\none of the best landmarks about here. The party in the Saddle Camp had\\nrelayed two of the sledges up the slope; these we hauled on to the top\\nwhile the two ponies were harnessed and brought up. There were three\\nsledges left to take on altogether, so the ponies took one each and we\\nthe other. Meanwhile Captain Scott walked over the shoulder under Castle\\nRock to see down the Strait and came back with the intelligence that he\\ncould hardly believe his eyes, but half the Glacier Tongue had broken off\\nand disappeared. This great Tongue of ice had stood there on arrival of\\nthe Discovery, ten years before, and had remained ever since; it had a\\ndep\xf4t of Shackleton\'s on it, and Campbell had dep\xf4ted his fodder on it\\nfor us. On the eventful night of the break-up of the ice at least three\\nmiles of the Tongue which had been considered practically terra firma had\\ngone, after having been there probably for centuries. We headed for the\\nhut: Bill had looked out a route for the ponies, to avoid slippery\\nplaces. It started to bliz, but was not too thick for us to see our\\nbearings. At the top of Ski Slope the ponies were taken out of the\\nsledges and led down a circuitous route over the rocks. The rest of us\\nput everything we wanted on one sledge and leaving the others up there\\nwent down the slope as before. The two ponies arrived before us and were\\nstabled in the verandah.\\n\\"That night for the first time since the establishment of Safety Camp the\\ndep\xf4t party were all together again, minus six ponies. In concluding my\\nreport to Captain Scott on the \'floe\' incident, which he asked me to set\\ndown long afterwards, I said, \'In reconsidering the foregoing I have come\\nto the conclusion that I underestimated the danger signs on the sea-ice\\non February 28, and on the following day might have attached more\\nimportance to the safety of my companions. As it was, however, all\\ncircumstances seemed to conspire together to make the situation\\nunavoidable.\' I did not forget to mention the splendid behaviour of\\nCherry and Crean, and, for my own part, I have no regrets. I took the\\nblame for my lack of experience, but knew that having done everything I\\ncould do, it did not concern me if anybody liked to criticize my action.\\nMy own opinion is that it just had to be, the circumstances leading to it\\nwere too devious for mere coincidence. Six hours earlier we could have\\nwalked to the hut on sound sea-ice. A few hours later we should have seen\\nopen water on arrival at the Barrier edge. The blizzard that knocked out\\nthe beasts, the death of Weary, the misunderstanding of the dogs,\\neverything, fitted in to place us on the sea-ice during the only two\\nhours of the whole year that we could possibly have been in such a\\nposition. Let those who believe in coincidence carry on believing. Nobody\\nwill ever convince me that there was not something more. Perhaps in the\\nlight of next year we shall see what was meant by such an apparent blow\\nto our hopes. Certainly we shall start for the Pole with less of that\\nfoolish spirit of blatant boast and ridiculous blind self-assurance, that\\ncharacterized some of us on leaving Cardiff.\\n\\"Poor Captain Scott had now a new anxiety thrust upon him. The Winter\\nStation with ponies, stores and motors was all situated on a low beach\\nnot twenty yards from the water\'s edge, and now that the ice had gone out\\n(and the hut was not six feet above sea-level at the floor) how had they\\nfared in the storm? This was a problem we could not solve without going\\nto see. Cape Evans, though dimly in sight, was as far off as New Zealand\\ntill the sea froze over. The idea of attempting the shoulder of Erebus\\ndid occur to Captain Scott, but it was so heavily crevassed as to make a\\njourney from our side almost impossible. On the other side Professor\\nDavid\'s party got up to the Summit without finding a crevasse. Captain\\nScott took his reverses like a brick. I often went out for a walk with\\nhim and sometimes he discussed his plans for next season. He took his\\nlosses very philosophically and never blamed any of us.\\"\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nThis is the end of that part of Bowers\' letter which deals with the\\nincident. Crean told me afterwards how he got on to the Barrier. He first\\nmade for the Gap, following the best path of the ice, but then had to\\nretrace his steps and make for White Island jumping from floe to floe.\\nBut then \\"I was pretty lively,\\" said he: and \\"there were lots of penguins\\nand seals and killers knocking round that day.\\"\\nCrean had one of the ski sticks and that \\"was a great help to me for\\ngetting over the floes. It was a sloping piece like what you were on and\\nit was very near touching the Barrier, in one corner of it only. Well, I\\ndug a hole with the ski stick in the side of the Barrier for a step for\\none foot, and when I finished the hole I straddled my legs and got one on\\nthe floe and one in the side of the Barrier. Then I got the stick and dug\\nit in on top and I gave myself a bit of a spring and got my outside leg\\nup top. It was a terrible place but I thought it was the only chance.\\n\\"I made straight for Safety Camp and they must have spotted me: for I\\nthink it was Gran that met me on skis. Then Scott and Wilson and Oates\\nmet me a long way out: I explained how it happened. He was\\nworried-looking a bit, but he never said anything out of the way. He told\\nOates to go inside and light the primus and give me a meal.\\"","image":"C05.12.png"},{"merge":"C05.13","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The author describes encountering Killer and Bottle-nosed whales while traveling on broken floes and calved bergs, and reflects on the fondness some of his expedition companions have for Hut Point despite its discomforts.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_1\\": \\"We made our way very slowly, sometimes waiting twenty minutes for the floe on which we were to touch the next one in the direction we were trying to go, but before us in the distance was a region of sea-ice which appeared to slope gradually up on to the fast Barrier beyond.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_2\\": \\"\\\\\\"Good God, look at the whales,\\\\\\" said some one, and there, in a pool of water behind the floe on which we were working, lay twelve great whales in perfect line, facing the floe.\\",\\n\\"text_to_image\\": \\"A group of Killer and Bottle-nosed whales swim in a lane of open water between broken floes and calved bergs, while a man and ponies make a slow and precarious journey towards a distant sloping area of sea-ice.

This was\\nimpressed upon me by one of the most dramatic moments of that night and\\nday.\\nWe made our way very slowly, sometimes waiting twenty minutes for the\\nfloe on which we were to touch the next one in the direction we were\\ntrying to go, but before us in the distance was a region of sea-ice which\\nappeared to slope gradually up on to the fast Barrier beyond. As we got\\nnearer we saw a dark line appear at intervals between the two. This we\\nconsidered was a crevasse at the edge of the Barrier which was opening\\nand shutting with the very big swell which was running, and on which all\\nthe floes were bobbing up and down. We told one another that we could\\nrush the ponies over this as it closed.\\nWe approached the Barrier and began to rise up on the sloping floes which\\nhad edged the Barrier and so on to small bergs which had calved from the\\nBarrier itself. Leaving Crean with the ponies, Bowers and I went forward\\nto prospect, and rose on to a berg from which we hoped to reach the\\nBarrier.\\nI can never forget the scene that met us. Between us and the Barrier was\\na lane of some fifty yards wide, a seething cauldron. Bergs were calving\\noff as we watched: and capsizing: and hitting other bergs, splitting into\\ntwo and falling apart. The Killers filled the whole place. Looking\\ndownwards into a hole between our berg and the next, a hole not bigger\\nthan a small room, we saw at least six whales. They were so crowded that\\nthey could only lie so as to get their snouts out of the water, and my\\nmemory is that their snouts were bottle-nosed. At this moment our berg\\nsplit into two parts and we hastily retreated to the lower and safer\\nfloes.\\nNow in the Zoological Report of the Discovery Expedition Wilson states\\nthat the true identity of the Bottle-nosed whale (Hyperoodon rostrata) in\\nAntarctic Seas has not been conclusively established. But that inasmuch\\nas it certainly frequents seas so far as 48\xb0 S. latitude it is probable\\nthat certain whales which he and other members of that expedition saw\\nfrequenting the edge of the ice were, as they appeared to be,\\nBottle-nosed whales. For my part, without great knowledge of whales, I am\\nconvinced that these whales which lay but twenty feet below us were\\nwhales of this species.\\nAfter our rescue by Scott we pitched our tents, as has been described, at\\nleast half a mile from the fast edge of the Barrier. All night long, or\\nas it really was, early morning, the Killers were snorting and blowing\\nunder the Barrier, and sometimes, it seemed, under our tents. Time and\\nagain some member of the party went out of the tent to see if the Barrier\\nhad not broken farther back, but there was no visible change, and it must\\nhave been that the apparently solid ice on which we were, was split up by\\ncrevasses by the big swell which had been running, and that round us,\\nhidden by snow bridges, were leads of water in which whales were cruising\\nin search of seal.\\nThe next day most of the ice had gone out to sea, and I do not think the\\nwhales were so numerous. The most noticeable thing about them that day\\nwas the organization shown by the band of whales which appeared after\\nBowers\' pony, Uncle Bill, had fallen between two floes, and we were\\ntrying to get him towards the Barrier. \\"Good God, look at the whales,\\"\\nsaid some one, and there, in a pool of water behind the floe on which we\\nwere working, lay twelve great whales in perfect line, facing the floe.\\nAnd out in front of them, like the captain of a company of soldiers, was\\nanother. As we turned they dived as one whale, led by the big fellow in\\nfront, and we certainly expected that they would attack the floe on which\\nwe stood. Whether they never did so, or whether they tried and failed,\\nfor the floes here were fifteen or sixteen feet thick, I do not know; we\\nnever saw them again.\\nOne other incident of those days is worth recalling. \\"Cherry, Crean,\\nwe\'re floating out to sea,\\" was the startling awakening from Bowers,\\nstanding in his socks outside the tent at 4.30 A.M. that Wednesday\\nmorning. And indeed at first sight on getting outside the tent it looked\\na quite hopeless situation. I thought it was madness to try and save the\\nponies and gear when, it seemed, the only chance at all of saving the men\\nwas an immediate rush for the Barrier, and I said so. \\"Well, I\'m going to\\ntry,\\" was Bowers\' answer, and, quixotic or no, he largely succeeded. I\\nnever knew a man who treated difficulties with such scorn.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nThere must be some of my companions who look back upon Hut Point with a\\npeculiar fondness, such as men get for places where they have experienced\\ngreat joys and great trials. And Hut Point has an atmosphere of its own.\\nI do not know what it is. Partly aesthetic, for the sea and great\\nmountains, and the glorious colour effects which prevail in spring and\\nautumn, would fascinate the least imaginative; partly mysterious, with\\nthe Great Barrier knocking at your door, and the smoke of Erebus by day\\nand the curtain of Aurora by night; partly the associations of the\\nplace--the old hut, the old landmarks, so familiar to those who know the\\nhistory of the Discovery Expedition, the stakes in the snow, the holes\\nfor which ice was dug to water the ship, Vince\'s Cross on the Point. Now\\nthere is another Cross, on Observation Hill.\\nAnd yet when we first arrived the hut was comfortless enough. Wilson and\\nMeares and Gran had been there some days; they had found some old bricks\\nand a grid, and there was an open blubber fire in the middle of the\\nfloor. There was no outlet for the smoke and smuts and it was impossible\\nto see your neighbour, to speak without coughing, or to open your eyes\\nlong before they began to smart. Atkinson and Crean had cleared the floor\\nof ice in our absence, but the space between the lower and upper roofs\\nwas solid with blue ice, and the lower roof sagged down in places in a\\ndangerous way. The wind howled continuously and to say that the hut was\\ncold is a very mild expression of the reality.\\nThis hut was built by the Discovery Expedition, who themselves lived in\\nthe ship which lay off the shore frozen into the sea-ice, as a workroom\\nand as a refuge in case of shipwreck. It was useful to them in some ways,\\nbut was too large to heat with the amount of coal available, and was\\nrather a white elephant. Scott wrote of it that \\"on the whole our large\\nhut has been and will be of use to us, but its uses are never likely to\\nbe of such importance as to render it indispensable, nor cause it to be\\nsaid that circumstances have justified the outlay made on it, or the\\nexpenditure of space and trouble in bringing it to its final home. It is\\nhere now, however, and here it will stand for many a long year with such\\nsupplies as will afford the necessaries of life to any less fortunate\\nparty who may follow in our footsteps and be forced to search for food\\nand shelter.\\"[126]\\nWell! It was to be more useful to Scott in 1910 to 1913 than he imagined\\nin 1902. We found the place with its verandah complete, the remains of\\nthe two magnetic huts and a rubbish heap. It was wonderful what that\\nrubbish heap yielded up. Bricks to build a blubber stove, a sheet of iron\\nto put over the top of it, a length of stove piping to form a chimney.\\nSomehow somebody made cement, and built the bricks together, and one of\\nthe magnetic huts gave up its asbestos sheeting to insulate the chimney\\nfrom the woodwork of the roofs. An old door made a cook\'s table, old\\ncases turned upside down made seats. The provisions left by the Discovery\\nwere biscuits contained in some forty large packing cases. These we piled\\nup across the middle of our house as a bulkhead and the old Discovery\\nwinter awning was dug out of the snow outside and fixed against the wall\\nthus made to keep the warmth in. At night we cleared the floor space and\\nspread our bags.\\n[Illustration: HUT POINT FROM OBSERVATION HILL]","image":null},{"merge":"C05.14","output":"{\\n  \\"summary\\": \\"The explorers sheltered two ponies and multiple dogs outside while experiencing deadly weather conditions at Hut Point.

The more truculent dogs lay tethered outside, the more docile\\nwere allowed their freedom, but even so the dog fights were not\\ninfrequent. We had one poor little dog, Makaka by name. When unloading\\nthe ship this dog had been overrun by the sledge which he was helping to\\npull; he suffered again when the team of dogs fell down the crevasse, and\\nwas now partially paralysed. He was a wretched object, for the hair\\nrefused to grow on his hind quarters, but he was a real sportsman and had\\nno idea of giving in. Meares and I went out one night when it was blowing\\nhard, attracted by the cries of a dog. It was Makaka who had ventured to\\nclimb a steep slope and was now afraid to return. When the dogs finally\\nreturned to Cape Evans, Makaka was allowed to run by the side of the\\nteam; but when Cape Evans was reached he was gone. Search failed to find\\nhim and, after some weeks, hope of him was abandoned. But a month\\nafterwards Gran and Debenham went over to Hut Point, and here at the\\nentrance of the hut they found Makaka, pitifully weak but able to bark to\\nthem. He must have lived on seal, but how he did so in that condition is\\na mystery.\\nThe reader may ask how it was that being so near our Winter Quarters at\\nCape Evans we were unable to reach them immediately. Cape Evans is\\nfifteen miles across the sea from Hut Point, and though both huts are on\\nthe same island--Hut Point being at the end of a peninsula and Cape Evans\\non the remains of a flow of lava which juts out into the sea--the land\\nwhich joins the two has never yet been crossed by a sledge party owing to\\nthe great ice falls which cover the slopes of Erebus. A glance at the map\\nwill show that although Hut Point is surrounded with sea, or sea-ice, on\\nevery side except that of Arrival Heights, the Barrier abuts upon the Hut\\nPoint Peninsula to the south beyond Pram Point. Thus there is always\\ncommunication with the Barrier by a devious route by which indeed we had\\njust arrived, but farther progress north is cut off until the cold\\ntemperature of the autumn and winter causes the open sea to freeze. We\\narrived at Hut Point on March 5 and Scott expected to be able to cross on\\nthe newly-frozen ice by about March 21. However, it was nearly a month\\nafter that when the first party could pass to Cape Evans, and then only\\nthe Bays were frozen and the Sound was still open water, owing to the\\nwinds which swept the ice out to sea almost as soon as it was formed.\\nOn the top of all the anxieties which had oppressed him lately Scott had\\na great fear that a swell so phenomenal as to break up Glacier Tongue, a\\nlandmark which had probably been there for centuries, might have swept\\naway our hut at Cape Evans. He was so alarmed about it that he told\\nWilson and myself to prepare to form a sledging party with him to\\npenetrate the Erebus icefalls and reach Cape Evans. \\"Went yesterday to\\nCastle Rock with Wilson to see what chance there might be of getting to\\nCape Evans. The day was bright and it was quite warm walking in the sun.\\nThere is no doubt the route to Cape Evans lies over the worst corner of\\nErebus. From this distance (some 7 or 8 miles at least) the whole\\nmountain side looks a mass of crevasses, but a route might be found at a\\nlevel of 3000 or 4000 feet.\\"[127] After some days the project was\\nabandoned as being hopeless.\\nOn March 8 Bowers led a party to bring in the gear and provisions which\\nhad been left at Disaster Camp, the material, that is, which had been\\nrescued from the sea-ice. They were away three days and found the pulling\\nvery hard. \\"At the corner of the bay the Barrier was buckled into round\\nridges which took a couple of hours to cross. We marched for some time\\nalongside an enormous crevasse, which lay like a street near us. I\\nexamined it at one point which must have been 15 feet wide, and though it\\nwas impossible to see the bottom for snow cornices it was undoubtedly\\nopen as I could hear a seal blowing below.\\"[128]\\nBowers\' letter describes them dragging their heavy load up the slope to\\nCastle Rock: \\"It took us all the morning to reach Saddle Camp with the\\nloads in two journeys. I found a steady plod up a steep hill without\\nspells is better and less exhausting than a rush and a number of rests.\\nThis theory I put into practice with great success. I don\'t know whether\\neverybody saw eye to eye with me over the idea of getting to the top\\nwithout a spell. After the second sledge was up Atkinson said: \'I don\'t\\nmind you as a rule, but there are times when I positively hate you.\'\\"\\nDefoe could have written another Robinson Crusoe with Hut Point instead\\nof San Juan Fernandez. Our sledging supplies were mostly exhausted and we\\ndepended upon the seals we could kill for food, fuel and light. We were\\nsmutty as sweeps from the blubber we burned; and a more\\nblackguard-looking crew would have been hard to find. We spent our fine\\ndays killing, cutting up and carrying in seal when we could find them, or\\nclimbing the various interesting hills and craters which abound here, and\\nour evenings in long discussions which seldom settled anything. Some\\nlooked after dogs, and others after ponies; some made geological\\ncollections; others sketched the wonderful sunsets; but before and above\\nall we ate and slept. We must have spent a good twelve hours asleep in\\nour bags every day after our six weeks\' sledging. And we rested. Perhaps\\nthis is not everybody\'s notion of a very good time, but it was good\\nenough for us.\\nThe Weddell seal which frequents the seas which fringe the Antarctic\\ncontinent was a standby for most of our wants; for he can at a pinch\\nprovide not only meat to eat, fuel for your fire and oil for your lamp,\\nbut also leather for your finnesko and an antidote to scurvy. As he lies\\nout on the sea-ice, a great ungainly shape, nothing short of an actual\\nprod will persuade him to take much notice of an Antarctic explorer. Even\\nthen he is as likely as not to yawn in your face and go to sleep again.\\nHis instincts are all to avoid the water when alarmed, for he knows his\\nenemies the killer whales live there: but if you drive him into the water\\nhe is transformed in the twinkling of an eye into a thing of beauty and\\ngrace, which can travel and turn with extreme celerity and which can\\nsuccessfully chase the fish on which he feeds.\\nWe were lucky now in that a small bay of sea-ice, about an acre in\\nextent, still remained within two miles of us at a corner where Barrier,\\nsea, and land meet, called Pram Point by Scott in the Discovery days.\\nNow Pram Point during the summer months is one of the most populous seal\\nnurseries in McMurdo Sound. In this neighbourhood the Barrier, moving\\nslowly towards the Peninsula, buckles the sea-ice into pressure ridges.\\nAs the trough of each ridge is forced downwards, so in summer pools of\\nsea water are formed in which the seal make their holes and among these\\nridges they lie and bask in the sun: the males fight their battles, the\\nfemales bring forth their young: the children play and chase their tails\\njust like kittens. Now that the sea-ice had broken up, many seal were to\\nbe found in this sheltered corner under the green and blue ice-cliffs of\\nCrater Hill.\\nIf you go seal killing you want a big stick, a bayonet, a flensing knife\\nand a steel. Any big stick will do, so long as it will hit the seal a\\nheavy blow on the nose: this stuns him and afterwards mercifully he feels\\nno more. The bayonet knife (which should be fitted into a handle with a\\ncross-piece to prevent the slipping of the hand down on to the blade)\\nshould be at least 14 inches long without the handle; this is used to\\nreach the seal\'s heart. Our flensing knives were one foot long including\\nthe handle, the blades were seven inches long by 1\xbc inches broad: some\\nwere pointed and others round and I do not know which was best. The\\nhandles should be of wood as being warmer to hold.\\nKilling and cutting up seals is a gruesome but very necessary business,\\nand the provision of suitable implements is humane as well as economic in\\ntime and labour. The skin is first cut off with the blubber attached: the\\nmeat is then cut from the skeleton, the entrails cleaned out, the liver\\ncarefully excised. The whole is then left to freeze in pieces on the\\nsnow, which are afterwards collected as rock-like lumps. The carcass can\\nbe cut up with an axe when needed and fed to the dogs. Nothing except\\nentrails was wasted.\\n[Illustration: SEALS]\\n[Illustration: SEALS]\\n[Illustration: FROM THE SEA--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\n[Illustration: FROM THE SEA--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nLighting was literally a burning question. I do not know that any lamp\\nwas better than a tin matchbox fed with blubber, with strands of lamp\\nwick sticking up in it, but all kinds of patterns big and small were made\\nby proud inventors; they generally gave some light, though not a\\nbrilliant one. There were more ambitious attempts than blubber. The worst\\nof these perhaps was produced by Oates. Somebody found some carbide and\\nOates immediately schemed to light the hut with acetylene. I think he was\\nthe only person who did not view the preparation with ill-concealed\\nnervousness. However, Wilson took the situation into his tactful hands.\\nFor several days Oates and Wilson were deep in the acetylene plant scheme\\nand then, apparently without reason, it was found that it could not be\\ndone.

As\\nwe expected, this was the Geological party, consisting of Griffith\\nTaylor, Wright, Debenham and Seaman Evans, home from the Western\\nMountains. They entirely failed to recognize in our black faces the men\\nwhom they had last seen from the ship at Glacier Tongue. I hope their\\nstory will be told by Debenham. For days their doings were the topic of\\nconversation. Both numerically and intellectually they were an addition\\nto our party, which now numbered sixteen. Taylor especially is seldom at\\na loss for conversation and his remarks are generally original, if\\nsometimes crude. Most of us were glad to listen when the discussions in\\nwhich he was a leading figure raged round the blubber stove. Scott and\\nWilson were always in the thick of it, and the others chimed in as their\\ninterest, knowledge and experience led. Rash statements on questions of\\nfact were always dangerous, for our small community contained so many\\nspecialists that errors were soon exposed. At the same time there were\\nfew parts of the world that one or other of us had not visited at least\\nonce. Later, when we came to our own limited quarters, books of reference\\nwere constantly in demand to settle disputes. Such books as the Times\\nAtlas, a good encyclopaedia and even a Latin Dictionary are invaluable to\\nsuch expeditions for this purpose. To them I would add Who\'s Who.\\nFrom odd corners we unearthed some Contemporary Reviews, the Girls\' Own\\nPaper and the Family Herald, all of ten years ago! We also found encased\\nin ice an incomplete copy of Stanley Weyman\'s My Lady Rotha; it was\\ncarefully thawed out and read by everybody, and the excitement was\\nincreased by the fact that the end of the book was missing.\\n\\"Who\'s going to cook?\\" was one of the last queries each night, and two\\nmen would volunteer. It is not great fun lighting an ordinary coal fire\\non a cold winter\'s morning, but lighting the blubber fire at Hut Point\\nwhen the metal frosted your fingers and the frozen blubber had to be\\ninduced to drip was a far more arduous task. The water was converted from\\nits icy state and, by that time, the stove was getting hot, in inverse\\nproportion to your temper. Seal liver fry and cocoa with unlimited\\nDiscovery Cabin biscuits were the standard dish for breakfast, and when\\nit was ready a sustained cry of \'hoosh\' brought the sleepers from their\\nbags, wiping reindeer hairs from their eyes. I think I was responsible\\nfor the greatest breakfast failure when I fried some biscuits and\\nsardines (we only had one tin). Leaving the biscuits in the frying pan,\\nthe lid of a cooker, after taking it from the fire, they went on cooking\\nand became as charcoal. This meal was known as \'the burnt-offering.\' On\\nApril 1 Bowers prepared to make a fool of two of us by putting chaff in\\nour pannikins and covering the top only with seal meat. The plan turned\\nback upon the maker, for he had not enough left to make up the\\ndeficiency, and, as I found out many weeks afterwards, surreptitiously\\ngave up his own hoosh to the April fools and went without himself. Of\\nsuch are the small incidents which afforded real amusement and even live\\nin the memory as outstanding features of our existence.\\nBreakfast done, there was a general clean-up. One seized the apology for\\na broom which existed: day foot-gear, finnesko, hair socks, ordinary\\nsocks and puttees, took the place of fleecy sleeping-socks and fur-lined\\nsleeping-boots: lunch cooks began to make their preparations: ice was\\nfetched for water: a frozen chunk of red seal meat or liver was levered\\nand chopped with an ice axe from the general store of seal meat: fids of\\nsealskin, with the blubber attached, a good three inches of it perhaps,\\nwere brought in and placed by the stove, much as we bring in a scuttle of\\ncoal. Gradually the community scattered as duty or inclination led,\\nleaving some members to dig away the snow-drifts which had accumulated\\nround the door and windows during the night.\\nBy lunch time every one had some new item of interest. Wright had found a\\nnew form of ice crystal: Scott had tested the ice off the Point and found\\nit five inches thick: Wilson had found new seal holes off Cape Armitage,\\nand we had hopes of finding our food and fuel nearer home: Atkinson had\\nkilled an Emperor penguin which weighed over ninety pounds, a record: and\\nthe assistant zoologist felt he would have to skin it, and did not want\\nto do so: Meares had found an excellent place to roll stones down Arrival\\nHeights into the sea: Debenham had a new theory to account for the Great\\nBoulder, as a mammoth block different in structure from the surrounding\\ngeological features was called: Bowers had a scheme for returning from\\nthe Pole by the Plateau instead of the Barrier: Oates might be heard\\nsaying that he thought he could do with another chupattie. A favourite\\npastime was the making of knots. Could you make a clove hitch with one\\nhand?\\nThe afternoon was like the morning, save that the sun was now sinking\\nbehind the Western Mountains. These autumn effects were among the most\\nbeautiful sights of the world, and it was now that Wilson made the\\nsketches for many of the water-colours which he afterwards painted at\\nWinter Quarters. The majority were taken from the summit of Observation\\nHill, crouching under the lee of the rocks into which, nearly two years\\nafter, we built the Cross which now stands to commemorate his death and\\nthat of his companions. He sketched quickly with bare fingers and\\nmittened hands, jotting down the outlines of hills and clouds, and\\npencilling in the colours by name. After a minute, more or less, the\\nfingers become too cold for such work, and they must be put back into the\\nwool and fur mitts until they are again warm enough to continue. Pencil\\nand sketch book, a Winsor and Newton, were carried in a little\\nblubber-stained wallet on his belt. Scott carried his sledge diaries in\\nsimilar books in a similar wallet made of green Willesden canvas and\\nfastened with a lanyard.\\nThere was a good fug in the hut by dinner time: this was a mixed\\nblessing. It was good for our gear: sleeping-bags, finnesko, mitts, socks\\nwere all hung up and dried, most necessary after sledging, and most\\nimportant for the preservation of the skins; but it also started the most\\ninfernal drip-drip from the roof. I have spoken of the double roof of the\\nold Discovery hut. This was still full of solid ice; indeed some time\\nafterwards a large portion of it fell, but luckily the inhabitants were\\noutside. The immediate problem was to prevent the leaks falling on\\nourselves, our food or our clothing and bags. And so every tin was\\nbrought into use and hung from leaky spots, while water chutes came into\\ntheir own. As the stove cooled so did the drip cease, and in no\\nprehistoric cavern did more stalactites and stalagmites grow apace.\\nOn March 16 the last sledge party to the Barrier that season started for\\nCorner Camp with provisions to increase the existing dep\xf4t there. The\\nparty was in charge of Lieutenant Evans, and consisted of Bowers, Oates,\\nAtkinson, Wright, and myself, with two seamen, Crean and Forde. The\\njourney out and back took eight days and was uneventful as sledge\\njourneys go. Thick weather prevailed for several days, and after running\\ndown our distance to Corner Camp we waited for it to clear. We found\\nourselves six miles from the dep\xf4t and among crevasses, which goes to\\nshow how easy it is to steer off the course under such conditions, and\\nhow creditable the navigation is when a course is kept correctly,\\nsometimes more by instinct than by skill.\\nBut we got our first experience of cold weather sledging which was\\nuseful. The minus thirties and forties are not very cold as we were to\\nunderstand cold afterwards, but quite cold enough to start with; cold\\nenough to teach you how to look after your footgear, handle metal and\\nnot to waste time. However, the sun was still well up during the day, and\\nthis makes all the difference, since any sun does more drying of clothes\\nand gear than none at all. At the same time we began to realize the\\ndifficulties which attend upon spring journeys, though we could only\\nimagine what might be the trials on a journey in mid-winter, such as we\\nintended to essay.\\nIt is easy to be wise after the event, but, in looking back upon the\\nexpedition as a whole, and the tragedy which was to come, mainly from the\\nunforeseen cold of the autumn on the Barrier (such as minus forties in\\nFebruary) it seems that we might have grasped that these temperatures\\nwere lower than might have been expected in the middle of March quite\\nnear the open sea. Even if this had occurred to any one, and I do not\\nthink that it did, I doubt whether the next step of reasoning would have\\nfollowed, namely, the possibility that the interior of the Barrier would,\\nas actually happened, prove to be much colder than was expected at this\\ndate. On the contrary I several times heard Scott mention the possibility\\nof the Polar Party not returning until April. At the same time it must be\\nrealized that pony transport to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier made a\\nlate start inevitable, for the blizzards our ponies had already suffered\\nproved that spring weather on the Barrier would be intolerable to them.\\nAs a matter of fact, Scott says in his Message to the Public, \\"no one in\\nthe world would have expected the temperature and surfaces which we\\nencountered at this time of the year.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C05.16","output":"Summary: The passage describes the return of a group from Erebus to Hut Point and their struggles with blizzards and newly formed ice.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"The large amount of snow which has fallen will make it very thick.

This was the result of a blizzard of which we only\\nfelt the tail end on the Barrier. Scott wrote: \\"The sea was breaking\\nconstantly and heavily on the ice foot. The spray carried right over the\\nPoint--covering all things and raining on the roof of the hut. Poor\\nVince\'s cross, some 30 feet above the water, was enveloped in it. Of\\ncourse the dogs had a very poor time, and we went and released two or\\nthree, getting covered in spray during the operation--our wind clothes\\nvery wet. This is the third gale from the South since our arrival here\\n(i.e. in 2\xbd weeks). Any one of these would have rendered the Bay\\nimpossible for a ship, and, therefore, it is extraordinary that we should\\nhave entirely escaped such a blow when the Discovery was in it in\\n1902.\\"[129]\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nIt is difficult to see long distances across open water at this time of\\nyear because the comparatively warm water throws up into the air a fog,\\nknown as frost-smoke. If there is a wind this smoke is carried over the\\nsurface of the sea, but if calm the smoke rises and forms a dense\\ncurtain. Standing on Arrival Heights, which form the nail of the\\nfinger-like Peninsula on which we now lived, we could see the four\\nislands which lie near Cape Evans, and a black smudge in the face of the\\nglaciers which descend from Erebus, which we knew to be the face of the\\nsteep slope above Cape Evans, afterwards named The Ramp. But, for the\\npresent, our comfortable hut might have been thousands of miles away for\\nall the good it was to us. As soon as the wind fell calm the sea was\\ncovered by a thin layer of ice, in twenty-four hours it might be four or\\nfive inches thick, but as yet it never proved strong enough to resist the\\nnext blizzard. In March the ice to the south was safe; there was\\nappearance of ice in the two bays at the foot of Erebus\' slopes in the\\nbeginning of April.\\nWe treated newly formed ice with far too little respect. It was on April\\n7 that Scott asked whether any of us would like to walk northwards over\\nthe newly formed ice towards Castle Rock. We had walked about two miles,\\nthe ice heaving up and down as we went, dodging the open pools and leads\\nto the best of our ability, when Taylor went right in. Luckily he could\\nlever himself out without help, and returned to the hut with all speed.\\nWe prepared to cross this ice to Cape Evans the next day, but the whole\\nof it went out in the night. On another occasion we were prepared to set\\nout the following morning, but the ice on which we were to cross went\\nout on the turn of the tide some five hours before we timed ourselves to\\nstart.\\nScott was of opinion that the ice in the two Bays under Erebus was firm,\\nand prepared to essay this route. The first of these bays is formed by\\nthe junction of the Hut Point Peninsula with Erebus to the south, and by\\nGlacier Tongue to the north. Crossing Glacier Tongue a party can descend\\non to the second bay beyond, the northern boundary of which is Cape\\nEvans. The Dellbridge Islands, of which Great Razorback is in direct line\\nbetween Glacier Tongue and Cape Evans, help to hold in any ice which\\nforms here. The route had never been attempted before, but it was hoped\\nthat a way down from the Peninsula on to the frozen sea might be found at\\nthe Hutton Cliffs, an outcrop of lava rock in the irregular ice face.\\n\\"A party consisting of Scott, Bowers, Taylor, and Seaman Evans with one\\ntent, and Lieutenant Evans, Wright, Debenham, Gran and Crean with\\nanother, started for Hut Point. It was dark to the south and snowing by\\nthe time they reached the top of Ski Slope. We helped them past Third\\nCrater. The ice from Hut Point to Glacier Tongue was impossible, and so\\nthey went on past Castle Rock and were to try and get down somewhere by\\nthe Hutton Cliffs on to some fast sea-ice which seemed to have held there\\nsome time, and so across Glacier Tongue on to sea-ice which also seemed\\nto be fast as far as Cape Evans.\\n\\"After lunch Wilson and I started about 4 P.M. in half a blizzard. It was\\nmuch better on the Heights and fairly clear towards Erebus, but we could\\nnot see any traces of the party on the ice.\\n\\"April 12. This morning as it was beginning to get light a blizzard\\nstarted, and it is blowing very hard now. The large amount of snow which\\nhas fallen will make it very thick. We are all anxious about the\\nreturning party, for Scott talked of camping on the sea-ice. The ice in\\nArrival Bay (just north of Hut Point) has gone out. They have\\nsleeping-bags, food for two meals, and a full primus for each tent.\\n\\"April 13. We were very anxious about the returning party, especially\\nwhen all the ice north of Hut Point went out. The blizzard blew itself\\nout this morning, and it was a great change to see White Island and The\\nBluff once more. Atkinson came in before lunch and told me that, looking\\nfrom the Heights, the ice from Glacier Tongue to Cape Evans appeared to\\nhave gone out. This sobered our lunch. We all made our way to Second\\nCrater afterwards, and found the ice from the Hutton Cliffs to Glacier\\nTongue and thence to Cape Evans was still in.\\n\\"Before leaving, Scott arranged to give V\xe9ry Lights at 10 P.M. from Cape\\nEvans on the first clear night of the next three. To-night is the third,\\nand the first clear night. We were out punctually, and then as we watched\\na flare blazed up, followed by quite a firework display. We all went wild\\nwith excitement--knowing that all was well. Meares ran in and soaked some\\nawning with paraffin, and we lifted it as an answering flare and threw it\\ninto the air again and again, until it was burning in little bits all\\nover the snow. The relief was great.\\"[130]\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nBowers must tell the story of the returning party:\\n\\"We topped the ridges and headed for Erebus beyond Castle Rock. It looked\\na little threatening at first, but cleared a bit as we got on. It was\\nquite interesting to be breaking new ground. Scott is a fine stepper in a\\nsledge, and he set a fast and easy swing all the time. It was snowing and\\nmisty when we got beyond the Hutton Cliffs, but we pitched the tents for\\nlunch before going down the slope. There was no doubt that a blizzard was\\ncoming up. It cleared during lunch, which we finished about 3.30 P.M., as\\nit had been a long morning march.\\n\\"It was just as well for us that the mist cleared, for the slope was not\\nonly crevassed in one direction, but it ended in a high ice-cliff. By\\nworking along we found a lowish place about thirty feet down from top to\\nbottom. Over this we lowered men and sledges. It had started to blow and\\nthe drift was flying off the cliff in clouds. We put in a couple of\\nstrong male bamboos to lower the last man away, leaving the Alpine rope\\nthere to facilitate ascent (i.e. for any party returning to Hut Point\\nwith food). We then repacked the sledges and headed across the bay\\ntowards the Glacier Tongue, where we arrived after dark about 6 P.M. The\\nyoung sea-ice was covered in a salt deposit which made it like pulling a\\nsledge over treacle instead of ice, and it was very heavy going after the\\nsnow uplands. The Tongue was mostly hard blue ice, which is slipperiness\\nitself, and crevassed every few yards. Most of these were bridged, but\\nyou were continually pushing a foot, or sometimes two, into nothingness,\\nin the semi-darkness. None of us, however, went down to the extent of our\\nharness.\\n\\"Arrived on the other side we struck a sheltered dip, where we decided to\\ncamp for something to eat. It was after 8 P.M. and I was for camping\\nthere for the night, as it seemed to me folly to venture upon a piece of\\nuntried newly frozen sea-ice in inky darkness, with a blizzard coming up\\nbehind us. Against this of course we were only five miles from Cape\\nEvans, and though we had hardly any grub with us, not having anticipated\\nthe cliff or the saltness of the sea-ice, and having to set out to do the\\njourney in one day, I thought hunger in a sleeping-bag better than lying\\nout in a blizzard on less than one foot of young ice.\\n\\"After a meal we started off at 9.30 P.M. in a snowy mist in which we\\ncould literally see nothing. It had fallen calm though, and at last we\\ncould see the outline of the nearest of the Dellbridge Islands called the\\nGreat Razorback; our course lay for a smaller island ahead called the\\nLittle Razorback. As we neared the Little Razorback Island the snow hid\\neverything; in fact we could hardly see the island itself when we were\\nright under it. It was impossible to go wandering on, so we had after all\\nto camp on the sea-ice. There was scarcely any snow to put on the\\nvalances of the tents, and the wet salt soaked the bags, and you knew\\nthat there was only about six or ten inches of precarious ice between you\\nand the black waters beneath. Altogether I decided that I for one would\\nlie awake in such an insecure camp.","image":null},{"merge":"C05.17","output":"This passage describes a blizzard the crew encountered, climbing an island to search for Cape Evans, finding a good campsite, arriving at the Winter Station, and a group of men staying behind.

Needless to say, I said that I was sure the camp\\nwas as safe as a church. At daylight Taylor dived out and in until the\\nwind from the door blew out the ice valance and the next moment the tent\\nclosed on us like an umbrella. We would never have spread it again had\\nnot some of the drift settled round us, and so we were able to secure it\\nafter an hour or two. The air was full of thick drift, and to work off\\nsome of Taylor\'s energy I said we might climb the island and look for\\nCape Evans.\\n\\"The island rose up straight from the sea at a sharp angle all round, and\\nwe climbed it with difficulty. On the top we saw the reason of its name,\\nas it was absolutely so sharp right along that you could bestride the top\\nas though sitting in a saddle. It was too windy sitting up there to be\\npleasant, so we descended, having seen nothing but clouds of flying snow,\\nand the peak of Inaccessible Island. At the bottom of the weather side we\\nfound a small ledge perfectly flat and just big enough to take two tents\\npitched close together. At this place the island made a wind buffer and\\nit was practically calm though the blizzard yelled all round. I urged\\nCaptain Scott to camp on this ledge and Taylor fizzled for making for\\nCape Evans, so Scott decided to ensure Taylor\'s safety, as he put it, and\\nwe made for the ledge. Once there we had an ideal camp on good hard\\nground and no wind, and had we had food the blizzard might have lasted a\\nweek for aught I cared.\\n[Illustration: THE HUT, EREBUS AND WHALE-BACK CLOUDS]\\n\\"We were two nights there and on the morning of the 13th it took off\\nenough for us to head for home. We saw Sunny Jim\'s [Simpson\'s]\\nObservatory on the Hill, but still did not know how the hut had fared\\ntill we got round the cape into North Bay. There was the Winter Station\\nall intact, however, and though North Bay had only just frozen in, it was\\nstrong enough to bear us safely. Somebody saw us and in another moment\\nthe hut poured out her little party, consisting of Sunny Jim, Ponting,\\nNelson, Day, Lashly, Hooper, Clissold, Dimitri and Anton. Ponting\'s face\\nwas a study as he ran up; he failed to recognize any of us and stopped\\ndead with a blank look--as he admitted afterwards, he thought it was the\\nNorwegian expedition for the space of a moment; and then we were all\\nbeing greeted as heartily as if we had really done something to be proud\\nof.\\n\\"The motors had had to be shifted, and a lot of gear placed higher up the\\nbeach, but the water had never reached near the hut, so all was well.\\nInside it looked tremendous, and we looked at our grimy selves in a glass\\nfor the first time for three months; no wonder Ponting did not recognize\\nthe ruffians. He photographed a group of us, which will amuse you some\\nday, when it is permissible to send photos. We ate heartily and had hot\\nbaths and generally civilized ourselves. I have since concluded that the\\nhut is the finest place in the southern hemisphere, but then I could not\\nshake down to it at once. I hankered for a sleeping-bag out on the snow,\\nor for the blubbery atmosphere of Hut Point. I expect the truth of the\\nmatter was that all my special pals, Bill, Cherry, Titus, and Atch, had\\nbeen left behind.\\n\\"We found eight ponies at Winter Quarters in the stable, Hackenschmidt\\nhaving died. These with our two at Hut Point left us with ten to start\\nthe winter with. I at once looked out the other big Siberian horse that\\nhad been a pair with my late lamented (they were the only Siberian\\nponies, all the rest being Manchurians) and singled him out for myself,\\nshould \'the powers that be\' be willing.\\n\\"A party had to return to Hut Point with some provision in a day or two,\\nso I asked to go. Captain Scott had decided to go himself, but said he\\nwould be very pleased if I would go too; so it being a fine day we left\\nthe following Monday. The two teams consisted of Captain Scott, Lashly,\\nDay and Dimitri with one tent and sledge, and Crean, Hooper, Nelson and\\nmyself with the other. We had it fine as far as the Glacier Tongue; and\\nthen along came the cheery old south wind in our faces; we crossed the\\nTongue and struggled against this till we could camp under the Hutton\\nCliffs where we got some shelter. All of us had our faces frost-bitten,\\nthe washing and shaving having made mine quite tender. It was a bit of a\\njob getting up the cliff: we had to stand on top of a pile of fallen ice\\nand hoist a 10-feet sledge on to our shoulders, at least on to the\\nshoulders of the tall ones; this just touched the overhanging cornice. A\\ncornice of snow is caused by continual drift over a sharp edge: it takes\\nall sorts of fantastic shapes, but usually hangs over like this. Looking\\nedgeways it looks as if it must fall down, but as a matter of fact is\\nusually very tough indeed. In this case steps were cut in it with an ice\\naxe from our extemporary ladder, and Captain Scott and I got up first.\\nWith the aid of a rope and the ladder we got the light ones up first, and\\nhauled up the gear last of all; hanging the sledge from the top with one\\nrope enabled the last two to struggle up it assisted by a rope round them\\nfrom above. It was a cold job and more frost-bites occurred in two of our\\nnovices, one on a foot and the other on a finger.\\n\\"We faced the blast again, but got it partially behind us on reaching the\\nHeights. We camped for the night under Castle Rock on an inclined slope.\\nIt calmed down to a glorious night with a low temperature. Crean and I\\nlay head down hill to make Nelson and Hooper--who had never sledged\\nbefore--more comfortable. As a result Crean slipped half out of the tent\\nand let in a cold stream of air under the valance, for which I was at a\\nloss to account until the morning disclosed him thus, fast asleep of\\ncourse. It takes a lot to worry Captain Scott\'s coxswain.\\n\\"We arrived at Hut Point and had a great reception there, chiefly on\\naccount of the food we brought, particularly the sugar. We had been\\nliving on some paraffin sugar when I left before, and even this was\\nfinished. The next day we stayed there to kill seals. Cherry and I\\nskinned one and then went for a walk round Cape Armitage. It was blowing\\nbig guns off the cape, fairly fizzing in fact. We went as far as Pram\\nPoint and then turned, coming in with it behind us. I only had a thin\\nbalaclava and my ears were nearly nipped.\\"[131]\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nMeanwhile those of us who had been left at Hut Point with the ponies and\\ndogs journeyed out one afternoon to Safety Camp to get some more bales of\\ncompressed fodder. Easter Sunday we spent in a howling blizzard, which\\ncleared in the afternoon sufficiently to see a golden sun sinking into a\\nsea of purple frost-smoke and drift.\\nI have it on record that we had tinned haddock this day for breakfast,\\nmade by Oates with great care, a biscuit and cheese hoosh for lunch, and\\na pemmican fry this evening, followed by cocoa with a tin of sweetened\\nNestl\xe9\'s milk in it, truly a great luxury. For the rest we mended our\\nfinnesko, and read Bleak House. Meares told us how the Chinese who were\\ngoing to war with the Lolos (who are one of the Eighteen tribes on the\\nborders of Thibet and China) tied the Lolo hostage to a bench, and,\\nhaving cut his throat, caught the blood which dripped from it. Into this\\nthey dipped their flag, and then cut out the heart and liver, which the\\nofficers ate, while the men ate the rest!\\nThe relief party arrived on April 18: \\"We had spent such a happy week,\\njust the seven of us, at the Discovery hut that I think, glad as we were\\nto see the men, we would most of us have rather been left undisturbed,\\nand I expected that it would mean that we should have to move homewards,\\nas it turned out.\\n\\"Meares is to be left in charge of the party which remains, namely Forde\\nand Keohane of the old stagers, and Nelson, Day, Lashly and Dimitri of\\nthe new-comers. He is very amusing with the stores and is evidently\\nafraid that the food which has just been brought in (sugar, self-raising\\nflour, chocolate, etc.) will all be eaten up by those who have brought\\nit. So we have dampers without butter, and a minimum of chocolate.\\n\\"Tuesday and Tuesday night was one of our few still, cold days, nearly\\nminus thirty. The sea northwards from Hut Point, whence the ice had\\npreviously all gone out, froze nearly five inches by Wednesday mid-day,\\nwhen we got three more seal.

It was blowing hard, as usual, at the\\nHutton Cliffs, and we got rather frost-bitten when lowering the sledges\\non to the sea-ice.

After lowering down the sledges over\\nthe cliffs we recovered the rope we had left in the first place, and then\\nstruck out over the sea-ice. Then our good runners told so much that I\\nowned up to mine being the better sledge, and offered to give them one of\\nmy team. This was declined, but after we crossed the Tongue Captain Scott\\nsaid he would like to change sledges at the Little Razorback. At any time\\nover this stretch we could have run away from his team, and once they got\\nour sledge they started that game on us. We expected it, and never had I\\nstepped out so hard before. We had been marching hard for nearly 12 hours\\nand now we had two miles\' spurt to do, and we should have stuck it, bad\\nrunners and all, had we had smooth ice. As it was we struck a belt of\\nrough ice, and in the dark we all stumbled and I went down a whack, that\\nnearly knocked me out. This was not noticed fortunately, and still we\\nhung on to the end of their sledge while I turned hot and cold and\\nsick and went through the various symptoms before I got my equilibrium\\nback, which I fortunately did while legging it at full speed. They\\nstarted to go ahead soon after that though, and we could not hold our\\nown, although we were close to the cape. I had the same thing happen\\nagain after another fall but we stuck it round the cape and arrived only\\nabout 50 yards behind. I have never felt so done, and so was my team. Of\\ncourse we need not have raced, but we did, and I would do the same thing\\nevery time. Titus produced a mug of brandy he had sharked from the ship\\nand we all lapped it up with avidity. The other team were just about laid\\nout, too, so I don\'t think there was much to be said either way.\\"[133]\\nTwo days later the sun appeared for the last time for four months.\\nLooking back I realized two things.

Whatever the\\nconditions of darkness, cold and wind, might be outside, there was\\ncomfort and warmth and good cheer within.\\nAnd there was a mass of work to be done, as well as at least two journeys\\nof the first magnitude ahead.\\nWhen Scott first sat down at his little table at Winter Quarters to start\\nworking out a most complicated scheme of weights and averages for the\\nSouthern Journey, his thoughts were gloomy, I know. \\"This is the end of\\nthe Pole,\\" he said to me, when he pulled us off the bergs after the\\nsea-ice had broken up; the loss of six ponies out of the eight with which\\nwe started the Dep\xf4t Journey, the increasing emaciation and weakness of\\nthe pony transport as we travelled farther on the Barrier, the arrival\\nof the dogs after their rapid journey home, starved rakes which looked as\\nthough they were absolutely done--these were not cheerful recollections\\nwith which to start to plan a journey of eighteen hundred miles.\\nOn the other hand, we had ten ponies left, though two or three of them\\nwere of more than doubtful quality; and it was obvious that considerable\\nimprovement could and must be made in the feeding of both ponies and\\ndogs. With regard to the dogs the remedy was plain; their ration was too\\nsmall. With regard to the ponies the question was not so simple. One of\\nthe main foods for the ponies which we had brought was compressed fodder\\nin the shape of bales. Theoretically this fodder was excellent food\\nvalue, and was made of wheat which was cut green and pressed. Whether it\\nwas really wheat or not I do not know, but there could be no two opinions\\nabout its nourishing qualities for our ponies. When fed upon it they lost\\nweight until they were just skin and bone. Poor beasts! It was pitiful to\\nsee them.\\nIn Oates we had a man who had forgotten as much as most men know about\\nhorses. It was no fault of his that this fodder was inadequate, nor that\\nwe had lost so many of the best ponies which we had. Oates had always\\nbeen for taking the worst ponies out on the Dep\xf4t Journey: travelling as\\nfar on to the Barrier as they could go, and there killing them and\\ndep\xf4ting their flesh. Now Oates took the ten remaining ponies into his\\ncapable hands. Some of them were scarecrows, especially poor Jehu, who\\nwas never expected to start at all, and ended by gallantly pulling his\\nsomewhat diminished load eight marches beyond One Ton Camp, a distance of\\n238 miles. Another, Christopher, was a man-killer if ever a horse was; he\\nhad to be thrown in order to attach him to the sledge; to the end he\\nwould lay out any man who was rash enough to give him the chance; once\\nstarted, and it took four men to achieve this, it was impossible to halt\\nhim during the day\'s march, and so Oates and his three tent mates and\\ntheir ponies had to go without any lunch meal for 130 miles of the\\nSouthern Journey.\\nOates trained them and fed them as though they were to run in the Derby.\\nThey were exercised whenever possible throughout the winter and spring by\\nthose who were to lead them on the actual journey. Fresh and good food\\nwas found in the shape of oilcake and oats, a limited quantity of each of\\nwhich had been brought and was saved for the actual Polar Journey, and\\neverything which care and foresight could devise was done to save them\\ndiscomfort. It is a grim life for animals, but in the end we were to know\\nthat up to the time of that bad blizzard almost at the Glacier Gateway,\\nwhich was the finishing post of these plucky animals, they had fed all\\nthey needed, slept as well and lived as well as any, and better than most\\nhorses in ordinary life at home. \\"I congratulate you, Titus,\\" said\\nWilson, as we stood under the shadow of Mount Hope, with the ponies\' task\\naccomplished, and \\"I thank you,\\" said Scott.\\nTitus grunted and was pleased.\\nTransport difficulties for the Polar Journey were considerable, but in\\nevery other direction the outlook was bright. The men who were to do the\\nsledging had been away from Winter Quarters for three months. They had\\nhad plenty of sledging experience, some of it none too soft. The sledges,\\nclothing, man-food, and outfit generally were excellent, although some\\nchanges were suggested and could be put into effect. There was no obvious\\nmeans, however, of effecting the improvement most desired, a satisfactory\\nsnow-shoe for the ponies.\\nThe work already accomplished was enormous. On the Polar Journey the\\nponies and dogs could now travel light for the first hundred and thirty\\ngeographical miles, when, at One Ton Camp, they would for the first time\\ntake their full loads: the advantage of being able to start again with\\nfull loads when so far on your way is obvious when it is considered that\\nthe distance travelled depends upon the weight of food that can be\\ncarried. During the geological journey on the western side of the Sound,\\nTaylor and his party had carried out much useful geological work in Dry\\nValley and on the Ferrar and Koettlitz Glaciers, which had been\\naccurately plotted for the charts, and had been examined for the first\\ntime by an expert physiographer and ice specialist. The ordinary routine\\nof scientific and meteorological observations usual with all Scott\'s\\nsledging parties was observed.\\nFurther, at Cape Evans there had been running for more than three months\\na scientific station, which rivalled in thoroughness and exactitude any\\nother such station in the world. I hope that later a more detailed\\naccount may be given of this continuous series of observations, some of\\nthem demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of them watched over\\nby enthusiastic experts. It must here suffice to say that we who on our\\nreturn saw for the first time the hut and its annexes completely equipped\\nwere amazed; though perhaps the gadget which appealed most to us at first\\nwas the electric apparatus by which the cook, whose invention it was,\\ncontrolled the rising of his excellent bread.\\nGlad as we were to find it all and to enjoy the food, bath and comfort\\nwhich it offered, we had no illusions about Cape Evans itself. It is\\nuninteresting, as only a low-lying spit of black lava covered for the\\nmost part with snow, and swept constantly by high winds and drift, can be\\nuninteresting. The kenyte lava of which it is formed is a remarkable\\nrock, and is found in few parts of the world: but when you have seen one\\nbit of kenyte you have seen all. Unlike the spacious and lofty Hut Point\\nPeninsula, thirteen miles to the south, it has no outstanding hills and\\ncraters; no landmarks such as Castle Rock. Unlike the broad folds of Cape\\nRoyds, six miles to the north, it has none of the rambling walks and\\nvaried lakes, in which is found most of the limited plant life which\\nexists in these latitudes, and though a few McCormick skuas meet here,\\nthere is no nursery of penguins such as that which makes Cape Royds so\\nattractive in summer. Nor has the Great Ice Sheet, which reached up\\nErebus and spread over the Ross Sea in the past, spilled over Cape Evans\\nin its retreat a wealth of foreign granites, dolerites, porphyrys and\\nsandstone such as cover the otherwise dull surface round Shackleton\'s old\\nWinter Quarters.\\nCape Evans is a low lava flow jutting out some three thousand feet from\\nthe face of the glaciers which clothe the slopes of Erebus. It is roughly\\nan equilateral triangle in shape, at its base some three thousand feet\\n(9/16th mile) across. This base-line, which divides the cape from the\\nslopes of Erebus and the crevassed glaciers and giant ice-falls which\\nclothe them, consists of a ramp with a slope of thirty degrees, and a\\nvarying height of some 100 to 150 feet. From our hut, four hundred yards\\naway, it looks like a great embankment behind which rises the majestic\\nvolcano Erebus, with its plume of steam and smoke.","image":null},{"merge":"C06.02","output":"This passage describes the geography surrounding Cape Evans in Antarctica, including the Barne Glacier, Erebus volcano, and the sea ice in McMurdo Sound.

The hollows\\nbetween the ridges are for the most part filled with snow and ice, while\\nin one or two places where the accumulation of snow is great enough there\\nare little glacierets which do not travel far before they ignominiously\\npeter out. There are two small lakes, called Skua Lake and Island Lake\\nrespectively. There is only one hill which is almost behind the hut, and\\nis called Wind Vane Hill, for on it were placed one of our wind vanes and\\ncertain other meteorological instruments. Into the glacieret which flowed\\ndown in the lee of this hill we drove two caves, which gave both an even\\nlow temperature and excellent insulation. One of them was therefore used\\nfor our magnetic observations, and the other as an ice-house for the\\nmutton we had brought from New Zealand.\\nThe north side, upon which we had built our hut, slopes down by way of a\\nrubbly beach to the sea in North Bay. We knew there was a beach for we\\nlanded upon it, but we never saw it again even in the height of summer,\\nfor the winter blizzards formed an ice foot several feet thick. The other\\nside of the cape ends abruptly in black bastions and baby cliffs some\\nthirty feet high. The apex of the triangle which forms as it were the\\ncape proper is a similar kenyte bluff. The whole makes a tricky place on\\nwhich to walk in the dark, for the surface is strewn with boulders of all\\nsizes and furrowed and channelled by drifts of hard and icy snow, and\\nquite suddenly you may find yourself prostrate upon a surface of slippery\\nblue ice. It may be easily imagined that it is no seemly place to\\nexercise skittish ponies or mules in a cold wind, but there is no other\\nplace when the sea-ice is unsafe.\\nCome and stand outside the hut door. All round you, except where the cape\\njoins the mountain, is the sea. You are facing north with your back to\\nthe Great Ice Barrier and the Pole, with your eyes looking out of the\\nmouth of McMurdo Sound over the Ross Sea towards New Zealand, two\\nthousand miles of open water, pack and bergs. Look over the sea to your\\nleft. It is mid-day, and though the sun will not appear above the horizon\\nhe is still near enough to throw a soft yellow light over the Western\\nMountains. These form the coast-line thirty miles across the Sound, and\\nas they disappear northwards are miraged up into the air and float, black\\nislands in a lemon sky. Straight ahead of you there is nothing to be seen\\nbut black open sea, with a high light over the horizon, which you know\\nbetokens pack; this is ice blink. But as you watch there appears and\\ndisappears a little dark smudge. This puzzles you for some time, and then\\nyou realize that this is the mirage of some far mountain or of Beaufort\\nIsland, which guards the mouth of McMurdo Sound against such traffic as\\never comes that way, by piling up the ice floes across the entrance.\\nAs you still look north, in the middle distance, jutting out into the\\nsea, is a low black line of land, with one excrescence. This is Cape\\nRoyds, with Shackleton\'s old hut upon it; the excrescence is High Peak,\\nand this line marks the first land upon the eastern side of McMurdo Sound\\nwhich you can see, and indeed is actually the most eastern point of Ross\\nIsland. It disappears abruptly behind a high wall, and if you let your\\neyes travel round towards your right front you see that the wall is a\\nperpendicular cliff two hundred feet high of pure green and blue ice,\\nwhich falls sheer into the sea, and forms, with Cape Evans, on which we\\nstand, the bay which lies in front of our hut, and which we called North\\nBay. This great ice-cliff with its crevasses, towers, bastions and\\ncornices, was a never-ending source of delight to us; it forms the snout\\nof one of the many glaciers which slide down the slopes of Erebus: in\\nsmooth slopes and contours where the mountain underneath is of regular\\nshape: in impassable icefalls where the underlying surface is steep or\\nbroken. This particular ice stream is called the Barne Glacier, and is\\nabout two miles across. The whole background from our right front to our\\nright rear, that is from N.E. to S.E., is occupied by our massive and\\nvolcanic neighbour, Erebus. He stands 13,500 feet high. We live beneath\\nhis shadow and have both admiration and friendship for him, sometimes\\nperhaps tinged with respect. However, there are no signs of dangerous\\neruptive disturbances in modern times, and we feel pretty safe, despite\\nthe fact that the smoke which issues from his crater sometimes rises in\\ndense clouds for many thousands of feet, and at others the trail of his\\nplume can be measured for at least a hundred miles.\\nIf you are not too cold standing about (it does not pay to stand about at\\nCape Evans) let us make our way behind the hut and up Wind Vane Hill.\\nThis is only some sixty-five feet high, yet it dominates the rest of the\\ncape and is steep enough to require a scramble, even now when the wind is\\ncalm. Look out that you do not step on the electric wires which connect\\nthe wind-vane cups on the hill with the recording dial in the hut. These\\ncups revolve in the wind, the revolutions being registered electrically:\\nevery four miles a signal was sent to the hut, and a pen working upon a\\nchronograph registered one more step. There is also a meteorological\\nscreen on the summit, which has to be visited at eight o\'clock each\\nmorning in all weathers.\\n[Illustration: A SUMMER VIEW OVER CAPE EVANS AND MCMURDO SOUND FROM THE\\nRAMP--Emery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\nArrived on the top you will now be facing south, that is in the opposite\\ndirection to which you were facing before. The first thing that will\\nstrike you is that the sea, now frozen in the bays though still unfrozen\\nin the open sound, flows in nearly to your feet. The second, that though\\nthe sea stretches back for nearly twenty miles, yet the horizon shows\\nland or ice in every direction. For a ship this is a cul-de-sac, as Ross\\nfound seventy years ago. But as soon as you have grasped these two\\nfacts your whole attention will be riveted to the amazing sight on your\\nleft. Here are the southern slopes of Erebus; but how different from\\nthose which you have lately seen. Northwards they fell in broad calm\\nlines to a beautiful stately cliff which edged the sea. But here--all the\\nepithets and all the adjectives which denote chaotic immensity could not\\nadequately tell of them. Visualize a torrent ten miles long and twenty\\nmiles broad; imagine it falling over mountainous rocks and tumbling over\\nitself in giant waves; imagine it arrested in the twinkling of an eye,\\nfrozen and white. Countless blizzards have swept their drifts over it,\\nbut have failed to hide it. And it continues to move. As you stand in the\\nstill cold air you may sometimes hear the silence broken by the sharp\\nreports as the cold contracts it or its own weight splits it. Nature is\\ntearing up that ice as human beings tear paper.\\nThe sea-cliff is not so high here, and is more broken up by crevasses and\\ncaves, and more covered with snow. Some five miles along the coast the\\nwhite line is broken by a bluff and black outcrop of rock; this is Turk\'s\\nHead, and beyond it is the low white line of Glacier Tongue, jutting out\\nfor miles into the sea. We know, for we have already crossed it, that\\nthere is a small frozen bay of sea-ice beyond, but all we can see from\\nCape Evans is the base of the Hut Point Peninsula, with a rock outcrop\\njust showing where the Hutton Cliffs lie. The Peninsula prevents us from\\nseeing the Barrier, though the Barrier wind is constantly flowing over\\nit, as the clouds of drift now smoking over the Cliffs bear witness.\\nFarther to the right still, the land is clear: Castle Rock stands up like\\na sentinel, and beyond are Arrival Heights and the old craters we have\\ngot to know so well during our stay at Hut Point. The Discovery hut,\\nwhich would, in any case, be invisible at fifteen miles, is round that\\nsteep rocky corner which ends the Peninsula, due south from where we\\nstand.\\nThere remains undescribed the quadrant which stretches to our right front\\nfrom south to west. Just as we have previously seen the line of the\\nWestern Mountains disappearing to the north miraged up in the light of\\nthe mid-day sun, so now we see the same line of mountains running south,\\nwith many miles of sea or Barrier between us and them. On the far\\nsouthern horizon, almost in transit with Hut Point, stands Minna Bluff,\\nsome ninety miles away, beyond which we have laid the One Ton Dep\xf4t, and\\nfrom this point, as our eyes move round to the right, we see peak after\\npeak of these great mountain ranges--Discovery, Morning, Lister, Hooker,\\nand the glaciers which divide them one from another. They rise almost\\nwithout a break to a height of thirteen thousand feet. Between us and\\nthem is the Barrier to the south, and the sea to the north. Unless a\\nblizzard is impending or blowing, they are clearly visible, a gigantic\\nwall of snow and ice and rock, which bounds our view to the west,\\nconstantly varied by the ever-changing colour of the Antarctic. Beyond is\\nthe plateau.","image":null},{"merge":"C06.03","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The author describes the volcanic islands near Cape Evans and their usefulness in holding in sea-ice and serving as landmarks.

The most important is a mile from the\\nend of Cape Evans and is called Inaccessible Island, owing to the\\ninhospitality of its steep lava side, even when the sea is frozen; we\\nfound a way up, but it is not a very interesting place. Tent Island lies\\nfarther out and to the south-west. The remaining two, which are more\\nislets than islands, rise in front of us in South Bay. They are called\\nGreat and Little Razorback, being ribs of rock with a sharp divide in the\\ncentre. The latter of these is the refuge upon which Scott\'s party\\nreturning to Cape Evans pitched their camp when overtaken by a blizzard\\nsome weeks ago. All these islands are of volcanic origin and black in\\ngeneral colour, but I believe there is evidence to show that the lava\\nstream which created them flowed from McMurdo Sound rather than from the\\nmore obvious craters of Erebus. Their importance in this story is the\\nindirect help they gave in holding in sea-ice against southerly\\nblizzards, and in forming landmarks which proved useful more than once to\\nmen who had lost their bearings in darkness and thick weather. In this\\nrespect also several icebergs which sailed in from the Ross Sea and\\ngrounded on the shallows which run between Inaccessible Island and the\\ncape, as well as in South Bay, were most useful as well as being\\ninteresting and beautiful. For two years we watched the weathering of\\nthese great towers and bastions of ice by sea and sun and wind, and left\\nthem still lying in the same positions, but mere tumbled ruins of their\\nformer selves.\\nMany places in the panorama we have examined show black rock, and the\\ncape on which we stand exposes at times more black than white. This fact\\nalways puzzles those who naturally conclude that all the Antarctic is\\ncovered with ice and snow. The explanation is simple, that winds of the\\ngreat velocity which prevails in this region will not only prevent snow\\nresting to windward of out-cropping rocks and cliffs, but will even wear\\naway the rocks themselves. The fact that these winds always blow from the\\nsouth, or southerly, causes a tendency for this aspect of any projecting\\nrock to be blown free from snow, while the north or lee side is drifted\\nup by a marbled and extremely hard tongue of snow, which disappears into\\na point at a distance which depends upon the size of the rock.\\nOf course for the most part the land is covered to such a depth by\\nglaciers and snow that no wind will do more than pack the snow or expose\\nthe ice beneath. At the same time, to visualize the Antarctic as a white\\nland is a mistake, for, not only is there much rock projecting wherever\\nmountains or rocky capes and islands rise, but the snow seldom looks\\nwhite, and if carefully looked at will be found to be shaded with many\\ncolours, but chiefly with cobalt blue or rose-madder, and all the\\ngradations of lilac and mauve which the mixture of these colours will\\nproduce. A White Day is so rare that I have recollections of going out\\nfrom the hut or the tent and being impressed by the fact that the snow\\nreally looked white. When to the beautiful tints in the sky and the\\ndelicate shading on the snow are added perhaps the deep colours of the\\nopen sea, with reflections from the ice foot and ice-cliffs in it, all\\nbrilliant blues and emerald greens, then indeed a man may realize how\\nbeautiful this world can be, and how clean.\\nThough I may struggle with inadequate expression to show the reader that\\nthis pure Land of the South has many gifts to squander upon those who\\nwoo her, chiefest of these gifts is that of her beauty. Next, perhaps, is\\nthat of grandeur and immensity, of giant mountains and limitless spaces,\\nwhich must awe the most casual, and may well terrify the least\\nimaginative of mortals. And there is one other gift which she gives with\\nboth hands, more prosaic, but almost more desirable. That is the gift of\\nsleep. Perhaps it is true of others as is certainly the case with me,\\nthat the more horrible the conditions in which we sleep, the more\\nsoothing and wonderful are the dreams which visit us. Some of us have\\nslept in a hurricane of wind and a hell of drifting snow and darkness,\\nwith no roof above our heads, with no tent to help us home, with no\\nconceivable chance that we should ever see our friends again, with no\\nfood that we could eat, and only the snow which drifted into our\\nsleeping-bags which we could drink day after day and night after night.\\nWe slept not only soundly the greater part of these days and nights, but\\nwith a certain numbed pleasure. We wanted something sweet to eat: for\\npreference tinned peaches in syrup! Well! That is the kind of sleep the\\nAntarctic offers you at her worst, or nearly at her worst. And if the\\nworst, or best, happens, and Death comes for you in the snow, he comes\\ndisguised as Sleep, and you greet him rather as a welcome friend than as\\na gruesome foe. She treats you thus when you are in the extremity of\\nperil and hardship; perhaps then you can imagine what draughts of deep\\nand healthy slumber she will give a tired sledger at the end of a long\\nday\'s march in summer, when after a nice hot supper he tucks his soft dry\\nwarm furry bag round him with the light beating in through the green silk\\ntent, the homely smell of tobacco in the air, and the only noise that of\\nthe ponies tethered outside, munching their supper in the sun.\\nAnd so it came about that during our sojourn at Cape Evans, in our\\ncomfortable warm roomy home, we took our full allotted span of sleep.\\nMost were in their bunks by 10 P.M., sometimes with a candle and a book,\\nnot rarely with a piece of chocolate. The acetylene was turned off at\\n10.30, for we had a limited quantity of carbide, and soon the room was\\nin complete darkness, save for the glow of the galley stove and where a\\nsplash of light showed the night watchman preparing his supper. Some\\nsnored loudly, but none so loud as Bowers; others talked in their sleep,\\nthe more so when some nasty experience had lately set their nerves on\\nedge. There was always the ticking of many instruments, and sometimes the\\nring of a little bell: to this day I do not know what most of them meant.\\nOn a calm night no sound penetrated except, perhaps, the whine of a dog,\\nor the occasional kick of a pony in the stable outside. Any disturbance\\nwas the night watchman\'s job. But on a bad blizzard night the wind, as it\\ntore seawards over the hut, roared and howled in the ventilator let into\\nthe roof: in the more furious gusts the whole hut shook, and the pebbles\\npicked up by the hurricane scattered themselves noisily against the\\nwoodwork of the southern wall. We did not get many nights like these the\\nfirst winter; during the second we seemed to get nothing else. One\\nghastly blizzard blew for six weeks.\\nThe night watchman took his last hourly observation at 7 A.M., and was\\nfree to turn in after waking the cook and making up the fire. Frequently,\\nhowever, he had so much work to do that he preferred to forgo his sleep\\nand remain up. For instance, if the weather looked threatening, he would\\ntake his pony out for exercise as soon as possible in the morning, or\\nthose lists of stores were not finished, or that fish trap had to be\\nlooked after: all kinds of things.\\nA sizzling on the fire and a smell of porridge and fried seal liver\\nheralded breakfast, which was at 8 A.M. in theory and a good deal later\\nin practice. A sleepy eye might see the meteorologist stumping out\\n(Simpson always stumped) to change the records in his magnetic cave and\\nvisit his instruments on the Hill. Twenty minutes later he would be back,\\nas often as not covered with drift and his wind helmet all iced up.\\nMeanwhile, the more hardy ones were washing: that is, they rubbed\\nthemselves, all shivering, with snow, of a minus temperature, and\\npretended they liked it. Perhaps they were right, but we told them it was\\nswank. I\'m not sure that it wasn\'t! It should be explained that water\\nwas seldom possible in a land where ice is more abundant than coal.\\nOne great danger threatened all our meals in this hut, namely that of a\\nCag. A Cag is an argument, sometimes well informed and always heated,\\nupon any subject under the sun, or temporarily in our case, the moon.\\nThey ranged from the Pole to the Equator, from the Barrier to Portsmouth\\nHard and Plymouth Hoe. They began on the smallest of excuses, they\\ncontinued through the widest field, they never ended; they were left in\\nmid air, perhaps to be caught up again and twisted and tortured months\\nafter. What caused the cones on the Ramp; the formation of ice crystals;\\nthe names and order of the public-houses if you left the Main Gate of\\nPortsmouth Dockyard and walked to the Unicorn Gate (if you ever reached\\nso far); the best kinds of crampons in the Antarctic, and the best place\\nin London for oysters; the ideal pony rug; would the wine steward at the\\nRitz look surprised if you asked him for a pint of bitter? Though the\\nTimes Atlas does not rise to public-houses nor Chambers\'s Encyclopaedia\\nsink to behaviour at our more expensive hotels, yet they settled more of\\nthese disputes than anything else.\\nOn the day we are discussing, though mutterings can still be heard from\\nNelson\'s cubicle, the long table has been cleared and every one is busy\\nby 9.30. From now until supper at 7 work is done by all in some form or\\nother, except for a short luncheon interval. I do not mean for a minute\\nthat we all sit down, as a man may do in an office at home, and solidly\\ngrind away for upwards of nine hours or more. Not a bit of it. We have\\nmuch work out of doors, and exercise is a consideration of the utmost\\nimportance. But when we go out, each individual quite naturally takes the\\nopportunity to carry out such work as concerns him, whether it deals with\\nice or rocks, dogs or horses, meteorology or biology, tide-gauges or\\nballoons.","image":null},{"merge":"C06.04","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The ponies were exercised between breakfast and mid-day, but it was difficult to do so in the dark.

Add to this the fact that one at\\nany rate of these variable animals was really savage, and that most of\\nthem were keen to break away if possible, and the hour of exercise was\\nnot without its thrills even on the calmest and most moonlight days. The\\nworst days were those when it was difficult to say whether the ponies\\nshould be taken out on the sea-ice or not. It was thick weather that was\\nto be feared, for then, if the leader once lost his bearings, it was most\\ndifficult for him to return. An overcast sky, light falling snow, perhaps\\na light northerly wind generally meant a blizzard, but the blizzard might\\nnot break for twenty-four hours, it might be upon you in four seconds. It\\nwas difficult to say whether the pony should miss his exercise, whether\\nthe fish trap should be raised, whether to put off your intended trip to\\nCape Royds. Generally the risks were taken, for, on the whole, it is\\nbetter to be a little over-bold than a little over-cautious, while always\\nthere was a something inside urging you to do it just because there was a\\ncertain risk, and you hardly liked not to do it. It is so easy to be\\nafraid of being afraid!\\nLet me give one instance: it must be typical of many. It was thick as it\\ncould be, no moon, no stars, light falling snow, and not even a light\\nbreeze to keep in your face to give direction. Bowers and I decided to\\ntake our ponies out, and once over the tide crack, where the working\\nsea-ice joins the fast land-ice, we kept close under the tall cliffs of\\nthe Barne Glacier. So far all was well, and also when we struck along a\\nsmall crack into the middle of the bay, where there was a thermometer\\nscreen. This we read with some difficulty by the light of a match and\\nstarted back towards the hut. In about a quarter of an hour we knew we\\nwere quite lost until an iceberg which we recognized showed us that we\\nhad been walking at right angles to our course, and got us safe home.\\nOn a clear crisp day, with the full moon to show you the ridges and\\ncracks and sastrugi, it was most pleasant to put on your ski and wander\\nforth with no object but that of healthy pleasure. Perhaps you would make\\nyour way round the bluff end of the cape and strike southwards. Here you\\nmay visit Nelson working with his thermometers and current meters and\\nother instruments over a circular hole in the ice, which he keeps open\\nfrom day to day by breaking out the \'biscuit\' of newly formed ice. He has\\nconnected himself with the hut by telephone, and built round himself an\\nigloo of drifted snow and the aforesaid \'biscuits,\' which effectually\\nshelter him from the wind. Or you may meet Meares and Dimitri returning\\nwith the dog-teams from a visit to Hut Point. A little farther on the\\nsilence is complete. But now your ear catches the metallic scratch of ski\\nsticks on hard ice; there is some one else ski-ing over there, it may be\\nmany miles away, for sound travels in an amazing way. Every now and then\\nthere comes a sharp crack like a pistol shot; it is the ice contracting\\nin the glaciers of Erebus, and you know that it is getting colder. Your\\nbreath smokes, forming white rime over your face, and ice in your beard;\\nif it is very cold you may actually hear it crackle as it freezes in mid\\nair!\\nThese were the days which remain visibly in the mind as the most\\nenjoyable during this first winter season. It was all so novel, these\\nmuch-dreaded, and amongst us much-derided, terrors of the Long Winter\\nNight. The atmosphere is very clear when it is not filled with snow or\\nice crystals, and the moonlight lay upon the land so that we could see\\nthe main outlines of the Hut Point Peninsula, and even Minna Bluff out on\\nthe Barrier ninety miles away. The ice-cliffs of Erebus showed as great\\ndark walls, but above them the blue ice of the glaciers gleamed silvery,\\nand the steam flowed lazily from the crater carried away in a long line,\\nshowing us that the northerly breezes prevailed up there, and were\\nstoring up trouble in the south. Sometimes a shooting star would seem to\\nfall right into the mountain, and for the most part the Aurora flitted\\nuneasily about in the sky.\\nThe importance of plenty of out-door exercise was generally recognized,\\nand our experience showed us that the happiest and healthiest members of\\nour party during this first year were those who spent the longest period\\nin the fresh air. As a rule we walked and worked and ski-ed alone, not I\\nfeel sure because of any individual distaste for the company of our\\nfellows but rather because of a general inclination to spend a short\\nperiod of the day without company. At least this is certainly true of the\\nofficers: I am not so sure about the men. Under the circumstances, the\\nonly time in the year that a man could be alone was in his walks abroad\\nfrom Winter Quarters, for the hut, of course, was always occupied, and\\nwhen sledging this sardine-like existence was continuous night and day.\\nThere was one regular exception to this rule. Every possible evening,\\nthat is to say if it was not blowing a full blizzard, Wilson and Bowers\\nwent up the Ramp together \'to read Bertram.\' Now this phrase will convey\\nlittle meaning without some explanation. I have already spoken of the\\nRamp as the steep rubbly slope partly covered by snow and partly by ice\\nwhich divided the cape on which we lived from the glaciated slopes of\\nErebus. After a breathless scramble up this embankment one came upon a\\nbelt of rough boulder-strewn ground from which arose at intervals conical\\nmounds, the origin of which puzzled us for many months. At length, by the\\nobvious means of cutting a section through one of them, it was proved\\nthat there was a solid kenyte lava block in the centre of this cone,\\nproving that the whole was formed by the weathering of a single rock.\\nThreading your way for some hundreds of yards through this terrain, a\\nscramble attended by many slips and falls on a dark night, you reached\\nthe first signs of glaciation. A little farther, isolated in the ice\\nstream, is another group of debris cones, and on the largest of these we\\nplaced meteorological Screen \\"B,\\" commonly called Bertram. This screen,\\ntogether with \\"A\\" (Algernon) and \\"C\\" (Clarence), which were in North and\\nSouth Bays respectively, were erected by Bowers, who thought, rightly,\\nthat they would form an object to which men could guide their walks, and\\nthat at the same time the observations of maximum, minimum and present\\ntemperatures would be a useful check to the meteorologist when he came to\\ncompare them with those taken at the hut. As a matter of fact the book in\\nwhich we used to enter these observations shows that the air temperatures\\nout on the sea-ice vary considerably from those on the cape, and that the\\ntemperatures several hundred feet up on the slopes of Erebus are often\\nseveral degrees higher than those taken at sea-level. I believe that much\\nof the weather in this part of the world is an intensely local affair,\\nand these screens produced useful data.\\nWilson and Bowers would go up the Ramp when it was blowing and drifting\\nfairly hard, so that although the rocks and landmarks immediately round\\nthem were visible, all beyond was blotted out. It is quite possible to\\nwalk thus among landmarks which you know at a time when it is most unwise\\nto go out on to the sea-ice where there are no fixed points to act as a\\nguide.\\nIt was Wilson\'s pleasant conceit to keep his balaclava rolled up, so that\\nhis face was bare, on such occasions, being somewhat proud of the fact\\nthat he had not, as yet, been frost-bitten. Imagine our joy when he\\nentered the hut one cold windy evening with two white spots on his cheeks\\nwhich he vainly tried to hide behind his dogskin mitts.\\n[Illustration: MCMURDO SOUND--Apsley Cherry-Garrard, del.--Emery Walker\\nLtd., Collotypers.]","image":null},{"merge":"C06.05","output":"This passage describes the daily routine of the men at their hut in the Antarctic, including their meals and leisure time activities such as listening to music and playing games, as well as the changing patterns of sunlight in the region. \\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"The business of eating over, pipes were lit without further formality...

Our own lunch was\\nsoon after one, and a few minutes before that time Hooper\'s voice would\\nbe heard: \\"Table please, Mr. Debenham,\\" and all writing materials,\\ncharts, instruments and books would have to be removed. On Sunday, this\\ntable displayed a dark blue cloth, but for meals and at all other times\\nit was covered with white oilcloth.\\nLunch itself was a pleasant meatless meal, consisting of limited bread\\nand butter with plenty of jam or cheese, tea or cocoa, the latter being\\nundoubtedly a most useful drink in a cold country. Many controversies\\nraged over the rival merits of tea and cocoa. Some of us made for\\nourselves buttered toast at the galley fire; I must myself confess to a\\nweakness for Welsh Rarebit, and others followed my example on cheese days\\nin making messes of which we were not a little proud. Scott sat at the\\nhead of the table, that is at the east end, but otherwise we all took our\\nplaces haphazard from meal to meal as our conversation, or want of it,\\nmerited, or as our arrival found a vacant chair. Thus if you felt\\ntalkative you might always find a listener in Debenham; if inclined to\\nlisten yourself it was only necessary to sit near Taylor or Nelson; if,\\non the other hand, you just wanted to be quiet, Atkinson or Oates would,\\nprobably, give you a congenial atmosphere.\\nThere was never any want of conversation, largely due to the fact that no\\nconversation was expected: we most of us know the horrible blankness\\nwhich comes over our minds when we realize that because we are eating we\\nare also supposed to talk, whether we have anything to say or not. It was\\nalso due to the more primitive reason that in a company of specialists,\\nwhose travels extended over most parts of the earth, and whose subjects\\noverlapped and interlocked at so many points, topics of conversation were\\nnot only numerous but full of possibilities of expansion. Add to this\\nthat from the nature of our work we were probably people of an\\ninquisitive turn of mind and wanted to get to the bottom of the subjects\\nwhich presented themselves, and you may expect to find, as was in fact\\nthe case, an atmosphere of pleasant and quite interesting conversation\\nwhich sometimes degenerated into heated and noisy argument.\\nThe business of eating over, pipes were lit without further formality. I\\nmention pipes only because while we had a most bountiful supply of\\ntobacco, the kindly present of Mr. Wills, our supply of cigarettes from\\nthe same source was purposely limited and only a small quantity were\\nlanded, allowing of a ration to such members who wished. Consequently\\ncigarettes were an article of some value, and in a land where the\\nordinary forms of currency are valueless they became a frequent stake to\\nventure when making bets. Indeed, \\"I bet you ten cigarettes,\\" or \\"I bet\\nyou a dinner when we get back to London,\\" became the most frequent bids\\nof the argumentative gambler, occasionally varied when the bettor was\\nmore than usually certain of the issue by the offer of a pair of socks.\\nBy two o\'clock we were dispersed once more to our various works and\\nduties. If it was bearable outside, the hut would soon be empty save for\\nthe cook and a couple of seamen washing up the plates; otherwise every\\none went out to make the most of any glimmering of daylight which still\\ncame to us from the sun below the northern horizon. And here it may be\\nexplained that whereas in England the sun rises more or less in the east,\\nis due south at mid-day, and sets in the west, this is not the case in\\nthe Antarctic regions. In the latitude in which we now lived the sun is\\nat his highest at mid-day in the north, at his lowest at midnight in the\\nsouth. As is generally known he remains entirely above the horizon for\\nfour months of the summer (October-February) and entirely below the\\nhorizon for four months in the winter (April 21-August 21). About\\nFebruary 27, the end of summer, he begins to set and rise due south at\\nmidnight; the next day he sets a little earlier and dips a little deeper.\\nDuring March and April he is going deeper and deeper every day, until, by\\nthe middle of April, he is set all the time except for just a peep over\\nthe northern horizon at mid-day, which is his last farewell before he\\ngoes away.\\nThe reverse process takes place from August 21 onwards. On this date the\\nsun just peeped above the sea to the north of our hut. The next day he\\nrose a little higher and longer, and in a few weeks he was rising well in\\nthe east and sinking behind the Western Mountains. But he did not stop\\nthere. Soon he was rising in the S.E. until in the latter days of\\nSeptember he never rose, for he never set; but circled round us by day\\nand night. On Midsummer Day (December 21) at the South Pole the sun\\ncircles round for twenty-four hours without changing his altitude for one\\nminute of a degree, but elsewhere he is always rising in the sky until\\nmid-day in the north and falling from that time until midnight in the\\nsouth.\\nOften, far too often, it was blizzing, and it was impossible to go out\\nexcept into the camp to take the observations, to care for the dogs, to\\nget ice for water or to bring in stores. Even a short excursion of a few\\nyards had to be made with great care under such circumstances, and\\ncertainly no one went outside more than was necessary, if only because\\none was obliged to dig the accumulated drift from the door before it was\\npossible to proceed. Blizzard or no blizzard, most men were back in the\\nhut soon after four, and from then until 6.30 worked steadily at their\\njobs. As supper time approached some kindly-disposed person would sit\\ndown and play on the Broadwood pianola which was one of our blessings,\\nand so it was that we came to supper with good tempers as well as keen\\nappetites.\\nSoup, in which the flavour of tomatoes occurred all too frequently,\\nfollowed by seal or penguin, and twice a week by New Zealand mutton, with\\ntinned vegetables, formed the basis of our meal, and this was followed by\\na pudding. We drank lime juice and water which sometimes included a\\nsuspicious penguin flavour derived from the ice slopes from which our\\nwater was quarried.\\nDuring our passage out to New Zealand in the ship (or as Meares always\\ninsisted on calling her, the steamer) it was our pleasant custom to have\\na glass of port or a liqueur after dinner. Alas, we had this no longer:\\nafter leaving New Zealand space allowed of little wine being carried in\\nthe Terra Nova, even if the general medical opinion of the expedition had\\nnot considered its presence undesirable. We had, however, a few cases for\\nspecial festivals, as well as some excellent liqueur brandy which was\\ncarried as medical comforts on our sledge journeys. Any officer who\\nallowed the distribution of this luxury on nearing the end of a journey\\nbecame extremely popular.\\nLack of wine probably led to the suspension of a custom which had\\nprevailed on the Terra Nova, namely, the drinking of the old toast of\\nSaturday night, \\"Sweethearts and wives; may our sweethearts become our\\nwives, and our wives remain our sweethearts,\\" and that more appropriate\\n(in our case) toast of Sunday, namely, \\"absent friends.\\" We had but few\\nmarried officers, though I must say most survivors of the expedition\\nhurried to remedy this single state of affairs when they returned to\\ncivilization. Only two of them are unmarried now. Most of them will\\nprobably make a success of it, for the good Arctic explorer has most of\\nthe defects and qualities of a good husband.\\nOn the top of the pianola, close to the head of the table, lived the\\ngramophone; and under the one looking-glass we possessed, which hung on\\nthe bulkhead of Scott\'s cubicle, was a home-made box with shelves on\\nwhich lay our records. It was usual to start the gramophone after dinner,\\nand its value may be imagined. It is necessary to be cut off from\\ncivilization and all that it means to enable you to realize fully the\\npower music has to recall the past, or the depths of meaning in it to\\nsoothe the present and give hope for the future. We had also records of\\ngood classical music, and the kindly-disposed individual who played them\\nhad his reward in the pleasant atmosphere of homeliness which made itself\\nfelt. After dinner had been cleared away, some men sat on at the table\\noccupied with books and games. Others dispersed to various jobs. In the\\nmatter of games it was noticeable that one would have its vogue and yield\\nplace to another without any apparent reason. For a few weeks it might be\\nchess, which would then yield its place to draughts and backgammon, and\\nagain come into favour. It is a remarkable fact that, though we had\\nplaying cards with us none of our company appeared desirous to use them.\\nIn fact I cannot remember seeing a game of cards played except in the\\nship on the voyage from England.\\n[Illustration: THE SEA\'S FRINGE OF ICE]","image":null},{"merge":"C06.06","output":"Summary: The passage discusses the types of books the members of the expedition read during their winter quarters and on sledging journeys, as well as provides insight into the personality and character of the expedition leader, Scott.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"Men never realized Scott until they had gone sledging with him.

With all respect to the kind givers\\nof these books, I would suggest that the literature most acceptable to\\nus in the circumstances under which we did most of our reading, that is\\nin Winter Quarters, was the best of the more recent novels, such as\\nBarrie, Kipling, Merriman and Maurice Hewlett. We certainly should have\\ntaken with us as much of Shaw, Barker, Ibsen and Wells as we could lay\\nour hands on, for the train of ideas started by these works and the\\ndiscussions to which they would have given rise would have been a godsend\\nto us in our isolated circumstances. The one type of book in which we\\nwere rich was Arctic and Antarctic travel. We had a library of these\\ngiven to us by Sir Lewis Beaumont and Sir Albert Markham which was very\\ncomplete. They were extremely popular, though it is probably true that\\nthese are books which you want rather to read on your return than when\\nyou are actually experiencing a similar life. They were used extensively\\nin discussions or lectures on such polar subjects as clothing, food\\nrations, and the building of igloos, while we were constantly referring\\nto them on specific points and getting useful hints, such as the use of\\nan inner lining to our tents, and the mechanism of a blubber stove.\\nI have already spoken of the importance of maps and books of reference,\\nand these should include a good encyclopaedia and dictionaries, English,\\nLatin and Greek. Oates was generally deep in Napier\'s History of the\\nPeninsular War, and some of us found Herbert Paul\'s History of Modern\\nEngland a great stand-by. Most of us managed to find room in our personal\\ngear when sledging for some book which did not weigh much and yet would\\nlast. Scott took some Browning on the Polar Journey, though I only saw\\nhim reading it once; Wilson took Maud and In Memoriam; Bowers always had\\nso many weights to tally and observations to record on reaching camp that\\nI feel sure he took no reading matter. Bleak House was the most\\nsuccessful book I ever took away sledging, though a volume of poetry was\\nuseful, because it gave one something to learn by heart and repeat during\\nthe blank hours of the daily march, when the idle mind is all too apt to\\nthink of food in times of hunger, or possibly of purely imaginary\\ngrievances, which may become distorted into real foundations of discord\\nunder the abnormal strain of living for months in the unrelieved company\\nof three other men. If your companions have much the same tastes as\\nyourself it is best to pool your allowance of weights and take one book\\nwhich will offer a wide field of thought and discussion. I have heard\\nScott and Wilson bless the thought which led them to take Darwin\'s Origin\\nof Species on their first Southern Journey. Such is the object of your\\nsledging book, but you often want the book which you read for half an\\nhour before you go to sleep at Winter Quarters to take you into the\\nfrivolous fripperies of modern social life which you may not know and may\\nnever wish to know, but which it is often pleasant to read about, and\\nnever so much so as when its charms are so remote as to be entirely\\ntantalizing.\\nScott, who always amazed me by the amount of work he got through without\\nany apparent effort, was essentially the driving force of the expedition:\\nin the hut quietly organizing, working out masses of figures, taking the\\ngreatest interest in the scientific work of the station, and perhaps\\nturning out, quite by the way, an elaborate paper on an abstruse problem\\nin the neighbourhood; fond of his pipe and a good book, Browning, Hardy\\n(Tess was one of his favourites), Galsworthy. Barrie was one of his\\ngreatest friends.\\nHe was eager to accept suggestions if they were workable, and always keen\\nto sift even the most unlikely theories if by any means they could be\\nshaped to the desired end: a quick and modern brain which he applied with\\nthoroughness to any question of practice or theory. Essentially an\\nattractive personality, with strong likes and dislikes, he excelled in\\nmaking his followers his friends by a few words of sympathy or praise: I\\nhave never known anybody, man or woman, who could be so attractive when\\nhe chose.\\nSledging he went harder than any man of whom I have ever heard. Men never\\nrealized Scott until they had gone sledging with him. On our way up the\\nBeardmore Glacier we were going at top pressure some seventeen hours out\\nof the twenty-four, and when we turned out in the morning we felt as\\nthough we had only just turned in. By lunch time we felt that it was\\nimpossible to get through in the afternoon a similar amount of work to\\nthat which we had done in the morning. A cup of tea and two biscuits\\nworked wonders, and the first two hours of the afternoon\'s march went\\npretty well, indeed they were the best hours\' marching of the day; but by\\nthe time we had been going some 4\xbd or 5 hours we were watching Scott for\\nthat glance to right and left which betokened the search for a good\\ncamping site. \\"Spell oh!\\" Scott would cry, and then \\"How\'s the enemy,\\nTitus?\\" to Oates, who would hopefully reply that it was, say, seven\\no\'clock. \\"Oh, well, I think we\'ll go on a little bit more,\\" Scott would\\nsay. \\"Come along!\\" It might be an hour or more before we halted and made\\nour camp: sometimes a blizzard had its silver lining. Scott could not\\nwait. However welcome a blizzard could be to tired bodies (I speak only\\nof summer sledging), to Scott himself any delay was intolerable. And it\\nis hard to realize how difficult waiting may be to one in a responsible\\nposition. It was our simple job to follow, to get up when we were roused,\\nto pull our hardest, to do our special work as thoroughly and quickly as\\npossible; it was Scott who had to organize distances and weights and\\nfood, as well as do the same physical work as ourselves. In sledging\\nresponsibility and physical work are combined to an extent seldom if ever\\nfound elsewhere.\\nHis was a subtle character, full of lights and shades.\\nEngland knows Scott as a hero; she has little idea of him as a man. He\\nwas certainly the most dominating character in our not uninteresting\\ncommunity: indeed, there is no doubt that he would carry weight in any\\ngathering of human beings. But few who knew him realized how shy and\\nreserved the man was, and it was partly for this reason that he so often\\nlaid himself open to misunderstanding.\\nAdd to this that he was sensitive, femininely sensitive, to a degree\\nwhich might be considered a fault, and it will be clear that leadership\\nto such a man may be almost a martyrdom, and that the confidence so\\nnecessary between leader and followers, which must of necessity be based\\nupon mutual knowledge and trust, becomes in itself more difficult. It\\nwanted an understanding man to appreciate Scott quickly; to others\\nknowledge came with experience.\\nHe was not a _very_ strong man physically, and was in his youth a weakly\\nchild, at one time not expected to live. But he was well proportioned,\\nwith broad shoulders and a good chest, a stronger man than Wilson, weaker\\nthan Bowers or Seaman Evans. He suffered from indigestion, and told me at\\nthe top of the Beardmore that he never expected to go on during the first\\nstage of the ascent.\\nTemperamentally he was a weak man, and might very easily have been an\\nirritable autocrat. As it was he had moods and depressions which might\\nlast for weeks, and of these there is ample evidence in his diary. The\\nman with the nerves gets things done, but sometimes he has a terrible\\ntime in doing them. He cried more easily than any man I have ever known.\\nWhat pulled Scott through was character, sheer good grain, which ran over\\nand under and through his weaker self and clamped it together. It would\\nbe stupid to say he had all the virtues: he had, for instance, little\\nsense of humour, and he was a bad judge of men. But you have only to read\\none page of what he wrote towards the end to see something of his sense\\nof justice. For him justice was God. Indeed I think you must read all\\nthose pages; and if you have read them once, you will probably read them\\nagain. You will not need much imagination to see what manner of man he\\nwas.\\nAnd notwithstanding the immense fits of depression which attacked him,\\nScott was the strongest combination of a strong mind in a strong body\\nthat I have ever known. And this because he was so weak! Naturally so\\npeevish, highly strung, irritable, depressed and moody. Practically such\\na conquest of himself, such vitality, such push and determination, and\\nwithal in himself such personal and magnetic charm. He was naturally an\\nidle man, he has told us so;[134] he had been a poor man, and he had a\\nhorror of leaving those dependent upon him in difficulties. You may read\\nit over and over again in his last letters and messages.[135]\\nHe will go down to history as the Englishman who conquered the South Pole\\nand who died as fine a death as any man has had the honour to die. His\\ntriumphs are many--but the Pole was not by any means the greatest of\\nthem. Surely the greatest was that by which he conquered his weaker self,\\nand became the strong leader whom we went to follow and came to love.\\n       *       *       *       *       *","image":null},{"merge":"C06.07","output":"This passage discusses the personnel on Scott\'s expedition to the south pole, including their roles and personalities.

The regular\\nsledgers in this party of officers were Scott, Wilson, Evans, Bowers,\\nOates (ponies), Meares (dogs), Atkinson (surgeon), Wright (physicist),\\nTaylor (physiographer), Debenham (geologist), Gran and myself, while Day\\nwas to drive his motors as far as they would go on the Polar Journey.\\nThis leaves Simpson, who was the meteorologist and whose observations had\\nof necessity to be continuous; Nelson, whose observations into marine\\nbiology, temperatures of sea, salinity, currents and tides came under the\\nsame heading; and Ponting, whose job was photography, and whose success\\nin this art everybody recognizes.\\nHowever much of good I may write of Wilson, his many friends in England,\\nthose who served with him on the ship or in the hut, and most of all\\nthose who had the good fortune to sledge with him (for it is sledging\\nwhich is far the greatest test) will all be dissatisfied, for I know that\\nI cannot do justice to his value. If you knew him you could not like him:\\nyou simply had to love him. Bill was of the salt of the earth. If I were\\nasked what quality it was before others that made him so useful, and so\\nlovable, I think I should answer that it was because he never for one\\nmoment thought of himself. In this respect also Bowers, of whom I will\\nspeak in a moment, was most extraordinary, and in passing may I be\\nallowed to say that this is a most necessary characteristic of a good\\nAntarctic traveller? We had many such, officers and seamen, and the\\nsuccess of the expedition was in no small measure due to the general and\\nunselfish way in which personal likes and dislikes, wishes or tastes were\\nungrudgingly subordinated to the common weal. Wilson and Pennell set an\\nexample of expedition first and the rest nowhere which others followed\\nungrudgingly: it pulled us through more than one difficulty which might\\nhave led to friction.\\nWilson was a man of many parts. He was Scott\'s right-hand man, he was the\\nexpedition\'s Chief of the Scientific Staff: he was a doctor of St.\\nGeorge\'s Hospital, and a zoologist specializing in vertebrates. His\\npublished work on whales, penguins and seals contained in the Scientific\\nReport of the Discovery Expedition is still the best available, and makes\\nexcellent reading even to the non-scientist. On the outward journey of\\nthe Terra Nova he was still writing up his work for the Royal Commission\\non Grouse Disease, the published report of which he never lived to see.\\nBut those who knew him best will probably remember Wilson by his\\nwater-colour paintings rather than by any other form of his many-sided\\nwork.\\nAs a boy his father sent him away on rambling holidays, the only\\ncondition being that he should return with a certain number of drawings.\\nI have spoken of the drawings which he made when sledging or when\\notherwise engaged away from painting facilities, as at Hut Point. He\\nbrought back to Winter Quarters a note-book filled with such sketches of\\noutlines and colours: of sunsets behind the Western Mountains: of lights\\nreflected in the freezing sea or in the glass houses of the ice foot: of\\nthe steam clouds on Erebus by day and of the Aurora Australis by night.\\nNext door to Scott he rigged up for himself a table, consisting of two\\nvenesta cases on end supporting a large drawing-board some four feet\\nsquare. On this he set to work systematically to paint the effects which\\nhe had seen and noted. He painted with his paper wet, and necessarily\\ntherefore, he worked quickly. An admirer of Ruskin, he wished to paint\\nwhat he saw as truly as possible. If he failed to catch the effect he\\nwished, he tore up the picture however beautiful the result he had\\nobtained. There is no doubt as to the faithfulness of his colouring: the\\npictures recalled then and will still recall now in intimate detail the\\neffects which we saw together. As to the accuracy of his drawing it is\\nsufficient to say that in the Discovery Expedition Scott wrote on his\\nSouthern Journey:\\n\\"Wilson is the most indefatigable person. When it is fine and clear, at\\nthe end of our fatiguing days he will spend two or three hours seated in\\nthe door of the tent, sketching each detail of the splendid mountainous\\ncoast-scene to the west. His sketches are most astonishingly accurate; I\\nhave tested his proportions by actual angular measurement and found them\\ncorrect.\\"[136]\\nIn addition to the drawings of land, pack, icebergs and Barrier, the\\nprimary object of which was scientific and geographical, Wilson has left\\na number of paintings of atmospheric phenomena which are not only\\nscientifically accurate but are also exceedingly beautiful. Of such are\\nthe records of auroral displays, parhelions, paraselene, lunar halos, fog\\nbows, irridescent clouds, refracted images of mountains and mirage\\ngenerally. If you look at a picture of a parhelion by Wilson not only can\\nyou be sure that the mock suns, circles and shafts appeared in the sky as\\nthey are shown on paper, but you can also rest assured that the number of\\ndegrees between, say, the sun and the outer ring of light were in fact\\nsuch as he has represented them. You can also be certain in looking at\\nhis pictures that if cirrus cloud is shown, then cirrus and not stratus\\ncloud was in the sky: if it is not shown, then the sky was clear. It is\\naccuracy such as this which gives an exceptional value to work viewed\\nfrom a scientific standpoint. Mention should also be made of the\\npaintings and drawings made constantly by Wilson for the various\\nspecialists on the expedition whenever they wished for colour records of\\ntheir specimens; in this connection the paintings of fish and various\\nparasites are especially valuable.\\nI am not specially qualified to judge Wilson from the artistic point of\\nview. But if you want accuracy of drawing, truth of colour, and a\\nreproduction of the soft and delicate atmospheric effects which obtain in\\nthis part of the world, then you have them here. Whatever may be said of\\nthe painting as such, it is undeniable that an artist of this type is of\\ninestimable value to an expedition which is doing scientific and\\ngeographical work in a little-known part of the earth.\\nWilson himself set a low value on his artistic capacity. We used to\\ndiscuss what Turner would have produced in a land which offered colour\\neffects of such beauty. If we urged him to try and paint some peculiar\\neffect and he felt that to do so was beyond his powers he made no scruple\\nof saying so. His colour is clear, his brush-work clean: and he handled\\nsledging subjects with the vigour of a professional who knew all there\\nwas to be known about a sledging life.\\n[Illustration: LEADING PONIES ON THE BARRIER--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nScott and Wilson worked hand in hand to further the scientific objects of\\nthe expedition. For Scott, though no specialist in any one branch, had a\\nmost genuine love of science. \\"Science--the rock foundation of all\\neffort,\\" he wrote; and whether discussing ice problems with Wright,\\nmeteorology with Simpson, or geology with Taylor, he showed not only a\\nmind which was receptive and keen to learn, but a knowledge which was\\nquick to offer valuable suggestions. I remember Pennell condemning\\nanything but scientific learning in dealing with the problems round us;\\n\'no guesswork\' was his argument. But he emphatically made an exception of\\nScott, who had an uncanny knack of hitting upon a solution. Over and\\nover again in his diary we can read of the interest he took in pure and\\napplied science, and it is doubtful whether this side of an expedition in\\nhigh northern or southern latitudes has ever been more fortunate in their\\nleader.\\nWilson\'s own share in the scientific results is more obvious because he\\nwas the director of the work. But no published reports will give an\\nadequate idea of the ability he showed in co-ordinating the various\\ninterests of a varied community, nor of the tact he displayed in dealing\\nwith the difficulties which arose. Above all his judgment was excellent,\\nand Scott as well as the rest of us relied upon him to a very great\\nextent. The value of judgment in a land where a wrong decision may mean\\ndisaster as well as loss of life is beyond all price; weather in which\\nchanges are most sudden is a case in point, also the state of sea-ice,\\nthe direction to be followed in difficult country when sledging, the best\\nway of taking crevassed areas when they must be crossed, and all the ways\\nby which the maximum of result may be combined with the minimum of danger\\nin a land where Nature is sometimes almost too big an enemy to fight: all\\nthis wants judgment, and if possible experience. Wilson could supply\\nboth, for his experience was as wide as that of Scott, and I have\\nconstantly known Scott change his mind after a talk with Bill. For the\\nrest I give quotations from Scott\'s diary:\\n\\"He has had a hand in almost every lecture given, and has been consulted\\nin almost every effort which has been made towards the solution of the\\npractical or theoretical problems of our Polar world.\\"[137]\\nAgain:","image":null},{"merge":"C06.08","output":"This passage describes the physical characteristics, skills, and personalities of several explorers in a party racing to the South Pole.

Wilson was not a particularly strong man. On\\nleaving with the Discovery he was but lately cured of consumption, yet he\\nwent with Scott to his farthest South, and helped to get Shackleton back\\nalive. Shackleton owed his life to those two. Wilson was of a slimmer,\\nmore athletic build, a great walker, 5 feet 10\xbd inches in height, 11\\nstones in weight, with a chest measurement of 36 inches. He was an ideal\\nexample of my contention, which I believe can be proved many times over\\nto be a fact, that it is not strength of body but rather strength of will\\nwhich carries a man farthest where mind and body are taxed at the same\\ntime to their utmost limit. Scott was 43 years of age at his death, and\\nWilson 39.\\nBowers was of a very different build. Aged 28, he was only 5 feet 4\\ninches in height while his chest measurement (which I give more as a\\ngeneral guide to his physique than for any other reason) was 40 inches,\\nand his weight 12 stones. He was recommended to Scott by Sir Clements\\nMarkham, who was dining one day with Captain Wilson-Barker on the\\nWorcester, on which ship Bowers was trained. Bowers was then home from\\nIndia, and the talk turned to the Antarctic. Wilson-Barker turned to Sir\\nClements in the course of conversation and alluding to Bowers said: \\"Here\\nis a man who will be leading one of those expeditions some day.\\"\\nHe lived a rough life after passing from the Worcester into the merchant\\nservice, sailing five times round the world in the Loch Torridon. Thence\\nhe passed into the service of the Royal Indian Marine, commanded a river\\ngunboat on the Irrawaddy, and afterwards served on H.M.S. Fox, where he\\nhad considerable experience, often in open boats, preventing the\\ngun-running which was carried on by the Afghans in the Persian Gulf.\\nThence he came to us.\\nIt is at any rate a curious fact, and it may be a significant one, that\\nBowers, who enjoyed a greater resistance to cold than any man on this\\nexpedition, joined it direct from one of the hottest places on the globe.\\nMy knowledge is insufficient to say whether it is possible that any trace\\ncan be found here of cause and effect, especially since the opposite\\nseems to be the more common experience, in that such people as return\\nfrom India to England generally find the English winter trying. I give\\nthe fact for what it may be worth, remarking only that the cold of an\\nEnglish winter is generally damp, while that of the Antarctic is dry, so\\nfar at any rate as the atmosphere is concerned. Bowers himself always\\nprofessed the greatest indifference not only to cold, but also to heat,\\nand his indifference was not that of a \'poseur,\' as many experiences will\\nshow.\\nAt the same time he was temperamentally one who refused to admit\\ndifficulties. Indeed, if he did not actually welcome them he greeted them\\nwith scorn, and in scorning went far to master them. Scott believed that\\ndifficulties were made to be overcome: Bowers certainly believed that he\\nwas the man to overcome them. This self-confidence was based on a very\\ndeep and broad religious feeling, and carried conviction with it. The men\\nswore by him both on the ship and ashore. \\"He\'s all right,\\" was their\\njudgment of his seamanship, which was admirable. \\"I like being with\\nBirdie, because I always know where I am,\\" was the remark made to me by\\nan officer one evening as we pitched the tent. We had just been spending\\nsome time in picking up a dep\xf4t which a less able man might well have\\nmissed.\\nAs he was one of the two or three greatest friends of my life I find it\\nhard to give the reader a mental picture of Birdie Bowers which will not\\nappear extravagant. There were times when his optimism appeared forced\\nand formal though I believe it was not really so: there were times when I\\nhave almost hated him for his infernal cheerfulness. To those accustomed\\nto judge men by the standards of their fashionable and corseted\\ndrawing-rooms Bowers appeared crude. \\"You couldn\'t kill that man if you\\ntook a pole-axe to him,\\" was the comment of a New Zealander at a dance at\\nChristchurch. Such men may be at a discount in conventional life; but\\ngive me a snowy ice-floe waving about on the top of a black swell, a ship\\nthrown aback, a sledge-party almost shattered, or one that has just upset\\ntheir supper on to the floorcloth of the tent (which is much the same\\nthing), and I will lie down and cry for Bowers to come and lead me to\\nfood and safety.\\nThose whom the gods love die young. The gods loved him, if indeed it be\\nbenevolent to show your favourites a clear, straight, shining path of\\nlife, with plenty of discomfort and not a little pain, but with few\\ndoubts and no fears. Browning might well have had Bowers in mind when he\\nwrote of\\n    One who never turned his back, but marched breast forward;\\n        Never doubted clouds would break;\\n    Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph;\\n        Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,\\n            Sleep to wake.\\nThere was nothing subtle about him. He was transparently simple,\\nstraightforward and unselfish. His capacity for work was prodigious, and\\nwhen his own work happened to take less than his full time he\\ncharacteristically found activity in serving a scientist or exercising an\\nanimal. So he used to help to send up balloons with self-recording\\ninstruments attached to them, and track the threads which led to them\\nwhen detached. He was responsible for putting up the three outlying\\nmeteorological screens and read them more often than anybody else. At\\ntimes he looked after some of the dogs because at the moment there was\\nnobody else whose proper job it happened to be, and he took a particular\\nfancy to one of our strongest huskies called Krisravitza, which is the\\nRussian (so I\'m told) for \'most beautiful.\' This fancy originated in the\\nfact that to Kris, as the most truculent of our untamed devils, fell a\\nlarge share of well-deserved punishment. A living thing in trouble be it\\ndog or man was something to be helped. Being the smallest man in the\\nparty he schemed to have allotted to him the largest pony available both\\nfor the Dep\xf4t and Polar Journeys. Their exercise, when he succeeded, was\\na matter for experiment, for his knowledge of horses was as limited as\\nhis love of animals was intense. He started to exercise his second pony\\n(for the first was lost on the floe) by riding him. \\"I\'ll soon get used\\nto him,\\" he said one day when Victor had just deposited him in the\\ntide-crack, \\"to say nothing of his getting used to me,\\" he added in a\\nmore subdued voice.\\nThis was open-air work, and as such more congenial than that which had to\\nbe done inside the hut. But his most important work was indoors, and he\\nbrought to it just the same restless enthusiasm which allowed no leisure\\nfor reading or relaxation.\\nHe joined as one of the ship\'s officers in London. Given charge of the\\nstores, the way in which he stowed the ship aroused the admiration of\\neven the stevedores, especially when he fell down the main hatch one\\nmorning on to the pig-iron below, recovered consciousness in about half a\\nminute, and continued work for the rest of the day as though nothing had\\nhappened.\\nAs the voyage out proceeded it became obvious that his knowledge of the\\nstores and undefeatable personality would be of great value to the shore\\nparty, and it was decided that he should land, to his great delight. He\\nwas personally responsible for all food supplies, whether for home\\nconsumption or for sledging, for all sledging stores and the distribution\\nof weights, the loading of sledges, the consumption of coal, the issue of\\nclothing, bosun\'s stores, and carpenter\'s stores. Incidentally the keeper\\nof stores wanted a very exact knowledge of the cases which contained\\nthem, for the drifts of snow soon buried them as they lay in the camp\\noutside.","image":null},{"merge":"C06.09","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"Bowers helped Scott by taking over routine station work and preparing plans for the Southern Journey.

Scott was a leader of men, and it is a good quality in\\nsuch to delegate work from themselves on to those who prove their power\\nto shoulder the burden. Undoubtedly Bowers saved Scott a great deal of\\nwork, and gave him time which he might not otherwise have been able to\\nspare to interest himself in the scientific work of the station, greatly\\nto its benefit, and do a good deal of useful writing. The two ways in\\nwhich Bowers helped Scott most this winter were in the preparation of the\\nplans and the working out of the weights of the Southern Journey, which\\nshall be discussed later, and in the routine work of the station, for\\nwhich he was largely responsible, and which ran so smoothly that I am\\nunable to tell the reader how the stores were issued, or the dinner\\nsettled, by what rule the working parties for fetching ice for water and\\nother kindred jobs about the camp were ordered. They just happened, and I\\ndon\'t know how. I only know that Bowers had the bunk above mine in the\\nhut, and that when I was going to sleep he was generally standing on a\\nchair and using his own bunk as a desk, and I conclude from the numerous\\nlists of stores and weights which are now in my hands that these were\\nbeing produced. Anyway the job was done, and the fact that we knew\\nnothing about it goes far to prove how efficiently it was carried\\nthrough.\\nFor him difficulties simply did not exist. I have never known a more\\nbuoyant, virile nature. Scott\'s writings abound in references to the\\nextraordinary value he placed upon his help, and after the share which he\\ntook in the Dep\xf4t and Winter Journeys it was clear that he would probably\\nbe taken in the Polar Party, as indeed proved to be the case. No man of\\nthat party better deserved his place. \\"I believe he is the hardest\\ntraveller that ever undertook a Polar Journey, as well as one of the most\\nundaunted.\\"[140]\\nThe standard is high.\\n[Illustration: FROZEN SEA AND CLIFFS OF ICE]\\nBowers gave us two of our best lectures, the first on the Evolution of\\nSledge Foods, at the end of which he discussed our own rations on the\\nDep\xf4t Journey, and made suggestions which he had worked out\\nscientifically for those of the Polar Journey. His arguments were sound\\nenough to disarm the hostility if not to convert to his opinions at least\\none scientist who had come to hear him strongly of opinion that an\\nuntrained man should not discuss so complex a subject. The second\\nlecture, on the Evolution of Polar Clothing, was also the fruit of much\\nwork. The general conclusion come to (and this was after the Winter\\nJourney) was that our own clothing and equipment could not be bettered in\\nany important respect, though it must be always understood that the\\nexpedition wore wind-proof clothing and not furs, except for hands and\\nfeet. When man-hauling, wind-proof, I am convinced, cannot be improved\\nupon, but for dog-driving in cold weather I suspect that furs may be\\nbetter.\\nThe table was cleared after supper and we sat round it for these lectures\\nthree times a week. There was no compulsion about them, and the seamen\\nonly turned up for those which especially interested them, such as\\nMeares\' vivid account of his journeyings on the Eastern or Chinese\\nborderland of Thibet. This land is inhabited by the \'Eighteen Tribes,\'\\nthe original inhabitants of Thibet who were driven out by the present\\ninhabitants, and Meares told us chiefly of the Lolos who killed his\\ncompanion Brook after having persuaded him that they were friendly and\\nanxious to help him. \\"He had no pictures and very makeshift maps, yet he\\nheld us really entranced for nearly two hours by the sheer interest of\\nhis adventures. The spirit of the wanderer is in Meares\' blood: he has no\\nhappiness but in the wild places of the earth. I have never met so\\nextreme a type. Even now he is looking forward to getting away by himself\\nto Hut Point, tired already of our scant measure of civilization.\\"[141]\\nThree lectures a week were too many in the opinion of the majority. The\\nsecond winter with our very reduced company we had two a week, and I feel\\nsure that this was an improvement. No officer nor seaman, however, could\\nhave had too many of Ponting\'s lectures, which gave us glimpses into\\nmany lands illustrated by his own inimitable slides. Thus we lived every\\nnow and then for a short hour in Burmah, India or Japan, in scenes of\\ntrees and flowers and feminine charm which were the very antithesis of\\nour present situation, and we were all the better for it. Ponting also\\nillustrated the subjects of other lectures with home-made slides of\\nphotographs taken during the autumn or from printed books. But for the\\nmost part the lecturers were perforce content with designs and plans,\\ndrawn on paper and pinned one on the top of the other upon a large\\ndrawing-board propped up on the table and torn off sheet by sheet.\\nFrom the practical point of view the most interesting evening to us was\\nthat on which Scott produced the Plan of the Southern Journey. The reader\\nmay ask why this was not really prepared until the winter previous to the\\njourney itself, and the answer clearly is that it was impossible to\\narrange more than a rough idea until the autumn sledging had taught its\\nlesson in food, equipment, relative reliability of dogs, ponies and men,\\nand until the changes and chances of our life showed exactly what\\ntransport would be available for the following sledging season. Thus it\\nwas with lively anticipation that we sat down on May 8, an advisory\\ncommittee as it were, to hear and give our suggestions on the scheme\\nwhich Scott had evolved in the early weeks of the winter after the\\nadventures of the Dep\xf4t Journey and the loss of six ponies.\\nIt was on just such a winter night, too, that Scott read his interesting\\npaper on the Ice Barrier and Inland Ice which will probably form the\\nbasis for all future work on these subjects. The Barrier, he maintained,\\nis probably afloat, and covers at least five times the extent of the\\nNorth Sea with an average thickness of some 400 feet, though it has only\\nbeen possible to get the very roughest of levels. According to the\\nmovement of a dep\xf4t laid in the Discovery days the Barrier moved 608\\nyards towards the open Ross Sea in 13\xbd months. It must be admitted that\\nthe inclination of the ice-sheet is not sufficient to cause this, and the\\nold idea that the glacier streams flowing down from Inland Plateau\\nprovide the necessary impetus is imperfect. It was Simpson\'s suggestion\\nthat \\"the deposition of snow on the Barrier leads to an expansion due to\\nthe increase of weight.\\" Some admittedly vague ideas as to the extent and\\ncharacter of the inland ice-sheet ended a clever and convincing paper\\nwhich contained a lot of good reasoning.\\nSimpson proved an excellent lecturer, and in meteorology and in the\\nexplanation of the many instruments with which his corner of the hut was\\nfull he possessed subjects which interested and concerned everybody.\\nNelson on Biological Problems and Taylor on Physiography were always\\ninteresting. \\"Taylor, I dreamt of your lecture last night. How could I\\nlive so long in the world and not know something of so fascinating a\\nsubject!\\" Thus Scott on the morning following one of these lectures.[142]\\nWright on Ice Problems, Radium, and the Origin of Matter had highly\\ntechnical subjects which left many of us somewhat befogged. But Atkinson\\non Scurvy had an audience each member of which felt that he had a\\npersonal interest in the subject under discussion. Indeed one of his\\nhearers was to suffer the advanced stage of this dread disease within six\\nmonths. Atkinson inclined to Almroth Wright\'s theory that scurvy is due\\nto an acid intoxication of the blood caused by bacteria. He described the\\nlitmus-paper test which was practised on us monthly, and before and after\\nsledge journeys. In this the blood of each individual is drawn and\\nvarious strengths of dilute sulphuric acid are added to it until it is\\nneutralized, the healthy man showing normal 30 to 50, while the man with\\nscorbutic signs will be normal 50 to 90 according to the stage to which\\nhe has reached. The only thing which is certain to stop scurvy is fresh\\nvegetables: fresh meat when life is otherwise under extreme conditions\\nwill not do so, an instance being the Siege of Paris when they had plenty\\nof horse meat. In 1795 voyages were being ruined by scurvy and Anson lost\\n300 out of 500 men, but in that year the first discoveries were made and\\nlime-juice was introduced by Blaine. From this time scurvy practically\\ndisappeared from the Navy, and there was little scurvy in Nelson\'s days;\\nbut the reason is not clear, since, according to modern research,\\nlime-juice only helps to prevent it. It continued in the Merchant\\nService, and in a decade from about 1865 some 400 cases were admitted\\ninto the Dreadnought Hospital, whereas in the decade 1887 to 1896 there\\nwere only 38 cases. We had, at Cape Evans, a salt of sodium to be used to\\nalkalize the blood as an experiment, if necessity arose. Darkness, cold,\\nand hard work are in Atkinson\'s opinion important causes of scurvy.\\nNansen was an advocate of variety of diet as being anti-scorbutic, and\\nScott recalled a story told him by Nansen which he had never understood.\\nIt appeared that some men had eaten tins of tainted food. Some of it was\\nslightly tainted, some of it was really bad. They rejected the really bad\\nones, and ate those only which were slightly tainted. \\"And of course,\\"\\nsaid Nansen, \\"they should have eaten the worst.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C06.10","output":"summary: The passage describes various opinions on scurvy and animal management during an Antarctic expedition.\\n\\nexcerpt_1: \\"Wilson was strongly of opinion that fresh meat alone would stop scurvy: on the Discovery seal meat cured it.\\"\\n\\nexcerpt_2: \\"A lean-to roof was built against the northern side of the hut, and the ends and open side were boarded up.

He tells me that he must have\\nbeen referring to the crew of the Windward, the ship of the\\nJackson-Harmsworth Expedition to Franz Josef Land in 1894-97. The crew of\\nthis ship, which was travelling to and from civilization, got scurvy,\\nthough the land party kept healthy. Of this Jackson writes: \\"In the case\\nof the crew of the Windward I fear that there was considerable\\ncarelessness in the use of tinned meats that were not free from taint,\\nalthough tins quite gone were rejected.... We [on shore] largely used\\nfresh bear\'s meat, and the crew of the Windward were also allowed as much\\nas they could be induced to eat. They, however, preferred tinned meat\\nseveral days a week to a diet of bear\'s meat alone; and some of the crew\\nhad such a prejudice against bear\'s meat as to refuse to eat it at\\nall.\\"[143]\\nOf course tainted food should not have been eaten at all, but if it had\\nto be eaten, then, according to Nansen, the ptomaines which cause scurvy\\nin the earlier stages of decomposition are destroyed by the ferment which\\nforms in the later stages. They should therefore have taken the worst\\ntins, if any at all.\\nWilson was strongly of opinion that fresh meat alone would stop scurvy:\\non the Discovery seal meat cured it. As to scurvy on Scott\'s Discovery\\nSouthern Journey, he made light of it: however, during the Winter Journey\\nI remember Wilson stating that Shackleton several times fell in a faint\\nas he got outside the tent, and he seems to have been seriously ill:\\nWilson knew that he himself had scurvy some time before the others knew\\nit, because the discoloration of his gums did not show in front for some\\ntime. He did not think their dogs on that journey had scurvy, but\\nptomaine poisoning from fish which had travelled through the tropics. He\\nwas of opinion that on returning from sledge journeys on the Discovery\\nthey had wrongly attributed to scurvy such symptoms as rash on the body,\\nswollen legs and ankles, which were rather the result of excessive\\nfatigue. I may add that we had these signs on our return from the Winter\\nJourney.\\nThen there were lectures on Geology by Debenham, on birds and beasts and\\nalso on Sketching by Wilson, on Surveying by Evans: but perhaps no\\nlecture remains more vividly in my memory than that given by Oates on\\nwhat _we_ called \'The Mismanagement of Horses.\' Of course to all of us\\nwho were relying upon the ponies for the first stage of the Southern\\nJourney the subject was of interest as well as utility, but the greater\\nshare of interest centred upon the lecturer, for it was certainly\\nsupposed that taciturn Titus could not have concealed about his person\\nthe gift of the gab, and it was as certain as it could be that the whole\\nbusiness was most distasteful to him. Imagine our delight when he proved\\nto have an elaborate discourse with full notes of which no one had seen\\nthe preparation. \\"I have been fortunate in securing another night,\\" he\\nmentioned amidst mirth, and proceeded to give us the most interesting and\\nable account of the minds and bodies of horses in general and ours in\\nparticular. He ended with a story of a dinner-party at which he was a\\nguest, probably against his will. A young lady was so late that the party\\nsat down to dinner without waiting longer. Soon she arrived covered with\\nblushes and confusion. \\"I\'m so sorry,\\" she said, \\"but that horse was the\\nlimit, he ...\\" \\"Perhaps it was a jibber,\\" suggested her hostess to help\\nher out. \\"No, he was a ----. I heard the cabby tell him so several\\ntimes.\\"\\nTitus Oates was the most cheerful and lovable old pessimist that you\\ncould imagine. Often, after tethering and feeding our ponies at a night\\ncamp on the Barrier, we would watch the dog-teams coming up into camp.\\n\\"I\'ll give these dogs ten days more,\\" he would murmur in a voice such as\\nsome people used when they heard of a British victory. I am acquainted\\nwith so few dragoons that I do not know their general characteristics.\\nFew of them, I imagine, would have gone about with the slouch which\\ncharacterized his method of locomotion, nor would many of them have dined\\nin a hat so shabby that it was picked off the peg and passed round as a\\ncuriosity.\\nHe came to look after the horses, and as an officer in the Inniskillings\\nhe, no doubt, had excellent training. But his skill went far deeper than\\nthat. There was little he didn\'t know about horses, and the pity is that\\nhe did not choose our ponies for us in Siberia: we should have had a very\\ndifferent lot. In addition to his general charge of them all, Oates took\\nas his own pony the aforesaid devil Christopher for the Southern Journey\\nand for previous training. We shall hear much more of Christopher, who\\nappeared to have come down to the Antarctic to initiate the well-behaved\\ninhabitants into all the vices of civilization, but from beginning to end\\nOates\' management of this animal might have proved a model to any\\ngovernor of a lunatic asylum. His tact, patience and courage, for\\nChristopher was a very dangerous beast, remain some of the most vivid\\nrecollections of a very gallant gentleman.\\nIn this connection let me add that no animals could have had more\\nconsiderate and often self-sacrificing treatment than these ponies of\\nours. Granted that they must be used at all (and I do not mean to enter\\ninto that question) they were fed, trained, and even clothed as friends\\nand companions rather than as beasts of burden. They were never hit, a\\ncondition to which they were clearly unaccustomed. They lived far better\\nthan they had before, and all this was done for them in spite of the\\nconditions under which we ourselves lived. We became very fond of our\\nbeasts but we could not be blind to their faults. The mind of a horse is\\na very limited concern, relying almost entirely upon memory. He rivals\\nour politicians in that he has little real intellect. Consequently, when\\nthe pony was faced with conditions different from those to which he was\\naccustomed, he showed but little adaptability; and when you add to this\\nfrozen harness and rugs, with all their straps and buckles and lashings,\\nan incredible facility for eating anything within reach including his own\\ntethering ropes and the headstalls, fringes and whatnots of his\\ncompanions, together with our own scanty provisions and a general wish to\\ndo anything except the job of the moment, it must be admitted that the\\npony leader\'s lot was full of occasions for bad temper. Nevertheless\\nleaders and ponies were on the best of terms (excepting always\\nChristopher), which is really not surprising when you come to think that\\nmost of the leaders were sailors whose love of animals is profound.\\nA lean-to roof was built against the northern side of the hut, and the\\nends and open side were boarded up. This building when buttressed by the\\nbricks of coal which formed our fuel, and drifted up with snow by the\\nblizzards, formed an extremely sheltered and even warm stable. The ponies\\nstood in stalls with their heads towards the hut and divided from it by a\\ncorridor; the bars which kept them in carried also their food boxes. They\\nlay down very little, the ground was too cold, and Oates was of opinion\\nthat litter would not have benefited them if we had had space in the ship\\nto bring it. The floor of their stall was formed of the gravel on which\\nthe hut was built. On any future occasion it might be worth consideration\\nwhether a flooring of wood might add to their comfort. As you walked down\\nthis narrow passage you passed a line of heads, many of which would have\\na nip at you in the semi-darkness, and at the far end Oates had rigged up\\nfor himself a blubber stove, more elaborate than the one we had made\\nwith the odds and ends at Hut Point, but in principle the same, in that\\nthe fids of sealskin with the blubber attached to them were placed on a\\ngrid, and the heat generated caused them to drop their oil on to ashes\\nbelow which formed the fire. This fire not only warmed the stable, but\\nmelted the snow to water the ponies and heated their bran mashes. I do\\nnot wonder that this warm companionable home appealed to their minds when\\nthey were exercising in the cold, dark, windy sea-ice: they were always\\ntrying to get rid of their leader, and if successful generally went\\nstraight back to the hut. Here they would dodge their pursuers until such\\ntime as they were sick of the game, when they quietly walked into the\\nstable of their own accord to be welcomed with triumphant squeals and\\nkickings by their companions.\\nI have already spoken of their exercise. Their ration during the winter\\nwas as follows:\\n    8 A.M. Chaff.\\n    12 NOON. Snow. Chaff and oats or oil-cake alternate days.\\n    5 P.M. Snow. Hot bran mash with oil-cake, or boiled oats and chaff;\\n    finally a small quantity of hay.\\nIn the spring they were got into condition on hard food all cold, and by\\na carefully increased scale of exercise during the latter part of which\\nthey drew sledges with very light loads.","image":null},{"merge":"C06.11","output":"{\\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the feeding, health, and status of ponies during the winter before the Antarctic expedition.

Certainly we should not have\\nbrought the bales of compressed fodder, which as I have already\\nexplained,[144] was theoretically green wheat cut young, but practically\\nno manner of use as a food, though of some use perhaps as bulk. Probably\\nhe would have used hay for this purpose at Winter Quarters had our stock\\nof it not been very limited, for hay takes up too much room on a ship\\nwhen every square inch of stowage space is of value. The original weights\\nof fodder with which we left New Zealand were: compressed chaff, 30\\ntons; hay, 5 tons; oil-cake, 5-6 tons; bran, 4-5 tons; and two kinds of\\noats, of which the white was better than the black. We wanted more bran\\nthan we had.[145] This does not exhaust our list of feeding stuffs, for\\none of our ponies called Snippets would eat blubber, and so far as I know\\nit agreed with him.\\nWe left New Zealand with nineteen ponies, seventeen of which were\\ndestined for the Main Party and two for the help of Campbell in the\\nexploration of King Edward VII.\'s Land. Two of these died in the big gale\\nat sea, and we landed fifteen ponies at Cape Evans in January. Of these\\nwe lost six on the Dep\xf4t Journey, while Hackenschmidt, who was a vicious\\nbeast, sickened and wasted away in our absence, for no particular reason\\nthat we could discover, until there was nothing to do but shoot him. Thus\\neight only out of the original seventeen Main Party ponies which started\\nfrom New Zealand were left by the beginning of the winter.\\nI have told[146] how, during our absence on the Dep\xf4t Journey, the ship\\nhad tried to land Campbell with his two ponies on King Edward VII.\'s\\nLand, but had been prevented from reaching it by pack ice. Coasting back\\nin search of a landing place they found Amundsen in the Bay of Whales.\\nUnder the circumstances Campbell decided not to land his party there but\\nto try and land on the north coast of South Victoria Land, in which he\\nwas finally successful. In the interval the ship returned to Cape Evans\\nwith the news, and since he was of opinion that his animals would be\\nuseless to him in that region he took the opportunity to swim the two\\nponies ashore, a distance of half a mile, for the ship could get no\\nnearer and the sea-ice had gone. Thus we started the winter with\\nCampbell\'s two ponies (Jehu and Chinaman), two ponies which had survived\\nthe Dep\xf4t Journey (Nobby and James Pigg), and six ponies which had been\\nleft at Cape Evans (Snatcher, Snippets, Bones, Victor, Michael and\\nChristopher) a total of ten.\\nOf these ten Christopher was the only real devil with vice, but he was a\\nstrong pony, and it was clear that he would be useful if he could be\\nmanaged. Bones, Snatcher, Victor and Snippets were all useful ponies.\\nMichael was a highly-strung nice beast, but his value was doubtful;\\nChinaman was more doubtful still, and it was questionable sometimes\\nwhether Jehu would be able to pull anything at all. This leaves Nobby and\\nJimmy Pigg, both of which were with us on the Dep\xf4t Journey. Nobby was\\nthe best of the two; he was the only survivor from the sea-ice disaster,\\nand I am not sure that his rescue did not save the situation with regard\\nto the Pole. Jimmy Pigg was wending his way slowly back from Corner Camp\\nat this time and so was also saved. He was a weak pony but did extremely\\nwell on the Polar Journey. It may be coincidence that these two ponies,\\nthe only ponies which had gained previous sledging experience, did better\\naccording to their strength than any of the others, but I am inclined to\\nbelieve that their familiarity with the conditions on the Barrier was of\\ngreat value to them, doing away with much useless worry and exhaustion.\\nAnd so it will be understood with what feelings of anxiety any cases of\\ninjury or illness to our ponies were regarded. The cases of injury were\\nfew and of small importance, thanks to the care with which they were\\nexercised in the dark on ice which was by no means free from\\ninequalities. Let me explain in passing that this ice is almost always\\ncovered by at least a thin layer of drifted snow and for the most part is\\nnot slippery. Every now and then there would be a great banging and\\ncrashing heard through the walls of the hut in the middle of the night.\\nThe watchman would run out, Oates put on his boots, Scott be audibly\\nuneasy. It was generally Bones or Chinaman kicking their stalls, perhaps\\nto keep themselves warm, but by the time the watchman had reached the\\nstable he would be met by a line of sleepy faces blinking at him in the\\nlight of the electric torch, each saying plainly that he could not\\npossibly have been responsible for a breach of the peace!\\nBut antics might easily lead to accidents, and more than once a pony was\\nfound twisted up in some way in his stall, or even to have fallen to the\\nground. Their heads were tied on either side to the stanchions of the\\nstall, and so if they tried to lie down complications might arise. More\\nalarming was the one serious case of illness, preceded by a slighter case\\nof a similar nature in another pony. Jimmy Pigg had a slight attack of\\ncolic in the middle of June, but he was feeding all right again during\\nthe evening of the same day. It was at noon, July 14, that Bones went off\\nhis feed. This was followed by spasms of acute pain. \\"Every now and again\\nhe attempted to lie down, and Oates eventually thought it was wiser to\\nallow him to do so. Once down, his head gradually drooped until he lay at\\nlength, every now and then twitching very horribly with the pain, and\\nfrom time to time raising his head and even scrambling to his legs when\\nit grew intense. I don\'t think I ever realized before how pathetic a\\nhorse could be under such conditions; no sound escapes him, his misery\\ncan only be indicated by those distressing spasms and by dumb movement of\\nthe head with a patient expression always suggestive of appeal.\\"[147]\\nTowards midnight it seemed that we were to lose him, and, apart from\\nother considerations, we knew that unless we could keep all the surviving\\nanimals alive the risks of failure in the coming journey were much\\nincreased.\\n\\"It was shortly after midnight when I [Scott] was told that the animal\\nseemed a little easier. At 2.30 I was again in the stable and found the\\nimprovement had been maintained; the horse still lay on its side with\\noutstretched head, but the spasms had ceased, its eye looked less\\ndistressed, and its ears pricked to occasional noises. As I stood looking\\nit suddenly raised its head and rose without effort to its legs; then in\\na moment, as though some bad dream had passed, it began to nose at some\\nhay and at its neighbour. Within three minutes it had drunk a bucket of\\nwater and had started to feed.\\"[148]\\nThe immediate cause of the trouble was indicated by \\"a small ball of\\nsemi-fermented hay covered with mucus and containing tape-worms; so far\\nnot very serious, but unfortunately attached to this mass was a strip of\\nthe lining of the intestine.\\"[149]\\nThe recovery of Bones was uninterrupted. Two day later another pony went\\noff his feed and lay down, but was soon well again.\\nConsiderable speculation as to the original cause of this illness never\\nfound a satisfactory answer. Some traced it to a want of ventilation, and\\nit is necessary to say that both the ponies who were ill stood next to\\nthe blubber stove; at any rate a big ventilator was fitted and more fresh\\nair let in. Others traced it to the want of water, supposing that the\\nanimals would not eat as much snow as they would have drunk water; the\\neasy remedy for this was to give them water instead of snow. We also gave\\nthem more salt than they had had before. Whatever the cause may have been\\nwe had no more of this colic, and the improvement in their condition\\nuntil we started sledging was uninterrupted.\\nAll the ponies were treated for worms; it was also found that they had\\nlice, which were eradicated after some time and difficulty by a wash of\\ntobacco and water. I know that Oates wished that he had clipped the\\nponies at the beginning of the winter, believing that they would have\\ngrown far better coats if this had been done. He also would have wished\\nfor a loose box for each pony.\\nNo account of the ponies would be complete without mention of our Russian\\npony boy, Anton. He was small in height, but he was exceedingly strong\\nand had a chest measurement of 40 inches.\\n[Illustration: EREBUS AND LANDS END]\\n[Illustration: EREBUS BEHIND GREAT RAZORBACK]","image":null},{"merge":"C06.12","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the daily life and scientific work of the British expedition crew in Antarctica, highlighting their dedication and the positive relationships among them.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_1\\": \\"We travelled for Science...that it may build on what it knows instead of on what it thinks.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_2\\": \\"Science is a big thing if you can travel a Winter Journey in her cause and not regret it.\\",\\n\\"text_to_image\\": \\"A man sacrificing his meager cigarette allowance to the phosphorescent lights he believes are devils rising out of the sea-ice, as his companion watches in bewilderment.\\" \\n}","parsed":{"summary":"The passage describes the daily life and scientific work of the British expedition crew in Antarctica, highlighting their dedication and the positive relationships among them.","excerpt_1":"We travelled for Science...that it may build on what it knows instead of on what it thinks.","excerpt_2":"Science is a big thing if you can travel a Winter Journey in her cause and not regret it.","text_to_image":"A man sacrificing his meager cigarette allowance to the phosphorescent lights he believes are devils rising out of the sea-ice, as his companion watches in bewilderment."},"passage":"I believe both Anton and Dimitri, the Russian dog driver, were brought\\noriginally to look after the ponies and dogs on their way from Siberia to\\nNew Zealand. But they proved such good fellows and so useful that we were\\nvery glad to take them on the strength of the landing party. I fear that\\nAnton, at any rate, did not realize what he was in for. When we arrived\\nat Cape Crozier in the ship on our voyage south, and he saw the two great\\npeaks of Ross Island in front and the Barrier Cliff disappearing in an\\nunbroken wall below the eastern horizon, he imagined that he reached\\nthe South Pole, and was suitably elated. When the darkness of the winter\\nclosed down upon us, this apparently unnatural order of things so preyed\\nupon his superstitious mind that he became seriously alarmed. Where the\\nsea-ice joined the land in front of the hut was of course a working\\ncrack, caused by the rise and fall of the tide. Sometimes the sea-water\\nfound its way up, and Anton was convinced that the weird phosphorescent\\nlights which danced up out of the sea were devils. In propitiation we\\nfound that he had sacrificed to them his most cherished luxury, his\\nscanty allowance of cigarettes, which he had literally cast upon the\\nwaters in the darkness. It was natural that his thoughts should turn to\\nthe comforts of his Siberian home, and the one-legged wife whom he was\\ngoing to marry there, and when it became clear that a another year would\\nbe spent in the South his mind was troubled. And so he went to Oates and\\nasked him, \\"If I go away at the end of this year, will Captain Scott\\ndisinherit me?\\" In order to try and express his idea, for he knew little\\nEnglish, he had some days before been asking \\"what we called it when a\\nfather died and left his son nothing.\\" Poor Anton!\\nHe looked long and anxiously for the ship, and with his kit-bag on his\\nshoulder was amongst the first to trek across the ice to meet her. Having\\nasked for and obtained a job of work there was no happier man on board:\\nhe never left her until she reached New Zealand. Nevertheless he was\\nalways cheerful, always working, and a most useful addition to our small\\ncommunity.\\nIt is still usual to talk of people living in complete married happiness\\nwhen we really mean, so Mr. Bernard Shaw tells me, that they confine\\ntheir quarrels to Thursday nights. If then I say that we lived this life\\nfor nearly three years, from the day when we left England until the day\\nwe returned to New Zealand, without any friction of any kind, I shall be\\nsupposed to be making a formal statement of somewhat limited truth. May I\\nsay that there is really no formality about it, and nothing but the\\ntruth. To be absolutely accurate I must admit to having seen a man in a\\nvery \'prickly\' state on one occasion. That was all. It didn\'t last and\\nmay have been well justified for aught I know: I have forgotten what it\\nwas all about. Why we should have been more fortunate than polar\\ntravellers in general it is hard to say, but undoubtedly a very powerful\\nreason was that we had no idle hours: there was no time to quarrel.\\nBefore we went South people were always saying, \\"You will get fed up with\\none another. What will you do all the dark winter?\\" As a matter of fact\\nthe difficulty was to get through with the work. Often after working all\\nthrough a long night-watch officers carried on as a matter of course\\nthrough the following day in order to clear off arrears. There was little\\nreading or general relaxation during the day: certainly not before\\nsupper, if at all. And while no fixed hours for work were laid down, the\\ncustom was general that all hours between breakfast and supper should be\\nso used.\\nOur small company was desperately keen to obtain results. The youngest\\nand most cynical pessimist must have had cause for wonder to see a body\\nof healthy and not unintellectual men striving thus single-mindedly to\\nadd their small quota of scientific and geographical knowledge to the sum\\ntotal of the world--with no immediate prospect of its practical utility.\\nLaymen and scientists alike were determined to attain the objects to gain\\nwhich they had set forth.\\nAnd I believe that in a vague intangible way there was an ideal in front\\nof and behind this work. It is really not desirable for men who do not\\nbelieve that knowledge is of value for its own sake to take up this kind\\nof life. The question constantly put to us in civilization was and still\\nis: \\"What is the use? Is there gold? or Is there coal?\\" The commercial\\nspirit of the present day can see no good in pure science: the English\\nmanufacturer is not interested in research which will not give him a\\nfinancial return within one year: the city man sees in it only so much\\nenergy wasted on unproductive work: truly they are bound to the wheel of\\nconventional life.\\nNow unless a man believes that such a view is wrong he has no business to\\nbe \'down South.\' Our magnetic and meteorological work may, I suppose,\\nhave a fairly immediate bearing upon commerce and shipping: otherwise I\\ncannot imagine any branch of our labours which will do more at present\\nthan swell the central pool of unapplied knowledge. The members of this\\nexpedition believed that it was worth while to discover new land and new\\nlife, to reach the Southern Pole of the earth, to make elaborate\\nmeteorological and magnetic observations and extended geological surveys\\nwith all the other branches of research for which we were equipped. They\\nwere prepared to suffer great hardship; and some of them died for their\\nbeliefs. Without such ideals the spirit which certainly existed in our\\nsmall community would have been impossible.\\nBut if the reasons for this happy state of our domestic life were due\\nlargely to the adaptability and keenness of the members of our small\\ncommunity, I doubt whether the frictions which have caused other\\nexpeditions to be less comfortable than they might have been, would have\\nbeen avoided in our case, had it not been for the qualities in some of\\nour men which set a fashion of hard work without any thought of personal\\ngain.\\nWith all its troubles it is a good life. We came back from the Barrier,\\ntelling one another we loathed the place and nothing on earth should make\\nus return. But now the Barrier comes back to us, with its clean, open\\nlife, and the smell of the cooker, and its soft sound sleep. So much of\\nthe trouble of this world is caused by memories, for we only remember\\nhalf.\\nWe have forgotten--or nearly forgotten--how the loss of a biscuit crumb\\nleft a sense of injury which lasted for a week; how the greatest friends\\nwere so much on one another\'s nerves that they did not speak for days for\\nfear of quarrelling; how angry we felt when the cook ran short on the\\nweekly bag; how sick we were after the first meals when we could eat as\\nmuch as we liked; how anxious we were when a man fell ill many hundreds\\nof miles from home, and we had a fortnight of thick weather and had to\\nfind our dep\xf4ts or starve. We remember the cry of _Camp Ho!_ which\\npreceded the cup of tea which gave us five more miles that evening; the\\ngood fellowship which completed our supper after safely crossing a bad\\npatch of crevasses; the square inch of plum pudding which celebrated our\\nChristmas Day; the chanties we sang all over the Barrier as we marched\\nour ponies along.\\nWe travelled for Science. Those three small embryos from Cape Crozier,\\nthat weight of fossils from Buckley Island, and that mass of material,\\nless spectacular, but gathered just as carefully hour by hour in wind and\\ndrift, darkness and cold, were striven for in order that the world may\\nhave a little more knowledge, that it may build on what it knows instead\\nof on what it thinks.\\nSome of our men were ambitious: some wanted money, others a name; some a\\nhelp up the scientific ladder, others an F.R.S. Why not? But we had men\\nwho did not care a rap for money or fame. I do not believe it mattered to\\nWilson when he found that Amundsen had reached the Pole a few days before\\nhim--not much. Pennell would have been very bored if you had given him a\\nknighthood. Lillie, Bowers, Priestley, Debenham, Atkinson and many others\\nwere much the same.\\nBut there is no love lost between the class of men who go out and do such\\nwork and the authorities at home who deal with their collections. I\\nremember a conversation in the hut during the last bad winter. Men were\\narguing fiercely that professionally they lost a lot by being down South,\\nthat they fell behindhand in current work, got out of the running and so\\nforth. There is a lot in that. And then the talk went on to the\\npublication of results, and the way in which they would wish them done. A\\nsaid he wasn\'t going to hand over his work to be mucked up by such and\\nsuch a body at home; B said he wasn\'t going to have his buried in museum\\nbook-shelves never to be seen again; C said he would jolly well publish\\nhis own results in the scientific journals. And the ears of the armchair\\nscientists who might deal with our hard-won specimens and observations\\nshould have been warm that night.\\nAt the time I felt a little indignant. It seemed to me that these men\\nought to think themselves lucky to be down South at all: there were\\nthousands who would have liked to take their place. But now I\\nunderstand quite a lot more than I did then. Science is a big thing if\\nyou can travel a Winter Journey in her cause and not regret it. I am\\nnot sure she is not bigger still if you can have dealings with\\nscientists and continue to follow in her path.\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [134] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 604.\\n   [135] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 599, 602, 607.\\n   [136] Scott, _Voyage of the Discovery_, vol. ii. p. 53.\\n   [137] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 295.\\n   [138] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. pp. 432-433.\\n   [139] Ibid. p. 597.\\n   [140] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 362.\\n   [141] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 396.\\n   [142] _With Scott: The Silver Lining_, Taylor, p. 240.\\n   [143] F.

Midwinter Night._\\nA hard night: clear, with a blue sky so deep that it looks black: the\\nstars are steel points: the glaciers burnished silver. The snow rings and\\nthuds to your footfall. The ice is cracking to the falling temperature\\nand the tide crack groans as the water rises. And over all, wave upon\\nwave, fold upon fold, there hangs the curtain of the aurora. As you\\nwatch, it fades away, and then quite suddenly a great beam flashes up and\\nrushes to the zenith, an arch of palest green and orange, a tail of\\nflaming gold. Again it falls, fading away into great searchlight beams\\nwhich rise behind the smoking crater of Mount Erebus. And again the\\nspiritual veil is drawn--\\n    Here at the roaring loom of Time I ply\\n    And weave for God the garment thou seest him by.\\nInside the hut are orgies. We are very merry--and indeed why not? The sun\\nturns to come back to us to-night, and such a day comes only once a year.\\nAfter dinner we had to make speeches, but instead of making a speech\\nBowers brought in a wonderful Christmas tree, made of split bamboos and a\\nski stick, with feathers tied to the end of each branch; candles, sweets,\\npreserved fruits, and the most absurd toys of which Bill was the owner.\\nTitus got three things which pleased him immensely, a sponge, a whistle,\\nand a pop-gun which went off when he pressed in the butt. For the rest of\\nthe evening he went round asking whether you were sweating. \\"No.\\" \\"Yes,\\nyou are,\\" he said, and wiped your face with the sponge. \\"If you want to\\nplease me very much you will fall down when I shoot you,\\" he said to me,\\nand then he went round shooting everybody. At intervals he blew the\\nwhistle.\\nHe danced the Lancers with Anton, and Anton, whose dancing puts that of\\nthe Russian Ballet into the shade, continually apologized for not being\\nable to do it well enough. Ponting gave a great lecture with slides which\\nhe had made since we arrived, many of which Meares had coloured. When one\\nof these came up one of us would shout, \\"Who coloured that,\\" and another\\nwould cry, \\"Meares,\\"--then uproar. It was impossible for Ponting to\\nspeak. We had a milk punch, when Scott proposed the Eastern Party, and\\nClissold, the cook, proposed Good Old True Milk. Titus blew away the\\nball of his gun. \\"I blew it into the cerulean--how doth Homer have\\nit?--cerulean azure--hence Erebus.\\" As we turned in he said, \\"Cherry, are\\nyou responsible for your actions?\\" and when I said Yes, he blew loudly on\\nhis whistle, and the last thing I remembered was that he woke up Meares\\nto ask him whether he was fancy free.\\nIt was a magnificent bust.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nFive days later and three men, one of whom at any rate is feeling a\\nlittle frightened, stand panting and sweating out in McMurdo Sound. They\\nhave two sledges, one tied behind the other, and these sledges are piled\\nhigh with sleeping-bags and camping equipment, six weeks\' provisions, and\\na venesta case full of scientific gear for pickling and preserving. In\\naddition there is a pickaxe, ice-axes, an Alpine rope, a large piece of\\ngreen Willesden canvas and a bit of board. Scott\'s amazed remark when he\\nsaw our sledges two hours ago, \\"Bill, why are you taking all this oil?\\"\\npointing to the six cans lashed to the tray on the second sledge, had a\\nbite in it. Our weights for such travelling are enormous--253 lbs. a man.\\nIt is mid-day but it is pitchy dark, and it is not warm.\\nAs we rested my mind went back to a dusty, dingy office in Victoria\\nStreet some fifteen months ago. \\"I want you to come,\\" said Wilson to me,\\nand then, \\"I want to go to Cape Crozier in the winter and work out the\\nembryology of the Emperor penguins, but I\'m not saying much about it--it\\nmight never come off.\\" Well! this was better than Victoria Street, where\\nthe doctors had nearly refused to let me go because I could only see the\\npeople across the road as vague blobs walking. Then Bill went and had a\\ntalk with Scott about it, and they said I might come if I was prepared to\\ntake the additional risk. At that time I would have taken anything.\\nAfter the Dep\xf4t Journey, at Hut Point, walking over that beastly,\\nslippery, sloping ice-foot which I always imagined would leave me some\\nday in the sea, Bill asked me whether I would go with him--and who else\\nfor a third? There can have been little doubt whom we both wanted, and\\nthat evening Bowers had been asked. Of course he was mad to come. And\\nhere we were. \\"This winter travel is a new and bold venture,\\" wrote Scott\\nin the hut that night, \\"but the right men have gone to attempt it.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C07.02","output":"{\\n    \\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes a winter journey to Cape Crozier in search of Emperor penguin eggs to study their embryology.

There never could have been any doubt about Bill and\\nBirdie. Probably Lashly would have made the best third, but Bill had a\\nprejudice against seamen for a journey like this--\\"They don\'t take enough\\ncare of themselves, and they _will_ not look after their clothes.\\" But\\nLashly was wonderful--if Scott had only taken a four-man party and Lashly\\nto the Pole!\\nWhat is this venture? Why is the embryo of the Emperor penguin so\\nimportant to Science? And why should three sane and common-sense\\nexplorers be sledging away on a winter\'s night to a Cape which has only\\nbeen visited before in daylight, and then with very great difficulty?\\nI have explained more fully in the Introduction to this book[150] the\\nknowledge the world possessed at this time of the Emperor penguin, mainly\\ndue to Wilson. But it is because the Emperor is probably the most\\nprimitive bird in existence that the working out of his embryology is so\\nimportant. The embryo shows remains of the development of an animal in\\nformer ages and former states; it recapitulates its former lives. The\\nembryo of an Emperor may prove the missing link between birds and the\\nreptiles from which birds have sprung.\\nOnly one rookery of Emperor penguins had been found at this date, and\\nthis was on the sea-ice inside a little bay of the Barrier edge at Cape\\nCrozier, which was guarded by miles of some of the biggest pressure in\\nthe Antarctic. Chicks had been found in September, and Wilson reckoned\\nthat the eggs must be laid in the beginning of July. And so we started\\njust after midwinter on the weirdest bird\'s-nesting expedition that has\\never been or ever will be.\\n[Illustration: EMPERORS]\\nBut the sweat was freezing in our clothing and we moved on. All we could\\nsee was a black patch away to our left which was Turk\'s Head: when this\\ndisappeared we knew that we had passed Glacier Tongue which, unseen by\\nus, eclipsed the rocks behind. And then we camped for lunch.\\nThat first camp only lives in my memory because it began our education of\\ncamp work in the dark. Had we now struck the blighting temperature which\\nwe were to meet....\\nThere was just enough wind to make us want to hurry: down harness, each\\nman to a strap on the sledge--quick with the floor-cloth--the bags to\\nhold it down--now a good spread with the bamboos and the tent inner\\nlining--hold them, Cherry, and over with the outer covering--snow on to\\nthe skirting and inside with the cook with his candle and a box of\\nmatches....\\nThat is how we tied it: that is the way we were accustomed to do it, day\\nafter day and night after night when the sun was still high or at any\\nrate only setting, sledging on the Barrier in spring and summer and\\nautumn; pulling our hands from our mitts when necessary--plenty of time\\nto warm up afterwards; in the days when we took pride in getting our tea\\nboiling within twenty minutes of throwing off our harness: when the man\\nwho wanted to work in his fur mitts was thought a bit too slow.\\nBut now it _didn\'t_ work. \\"We shall have to go a bit slower,\\" said Bill,\\nand \\"we shall get more used to working in the dark.\\" At this time, I\\nremember, I was still trying to wear spectacles.\\nWe spent that night on the sea-ice, finding that we were too far in\\ntowards Castle Rock; and it was not until the following afternoon that we\\nreached and lunched at Hut Point. I speak of day and night, though they\\nwere much the same, and later on when we found that we could not get the\\nwork into a twenty-four-hour day, we decided to carry on as though such a\\nconvention did not exist; as in actual fact it did not. We had already\\nrealized that cooking under these conditions would be a bad job, and that\\nthe usual arrangement by which one man was cook for the week would be\\nintolerable. We settled to be cook alternately day by day. For food we\\nbrought only pemmican and biscuit and butter; for drink we had tea, and\\nwe drank hot water to turn in on.\\nPulling out from Hut Point that evening we brought along our heavy loads\\non the two nine-foot sledges with comparative ease; it was the first, and\\nthough we did not know it then, the only bit of good pulling we were to\\nhave. Good pulling to the sledge traveller means easy pulling. Away we\\nwent round Cape Armitage and eastwards. We knew that the Barrier edge was\\nin front of us and also that the break-up of the sea-ice had left the\\nface of it as a low perpendicular cliff. We had therefore to find a place\\nwhere the snow had formed a drift. This we came right up against and met\\nquite suddenly a very keen wind flowing, as it always does, from the cold\\nBarrier down to the comparatively warm sea-ice. The temperature was -47\xb0\\nF., and I was a fool to take my hands out of my mitts to haul on the\\nropes to bring the sledges up. I started away from the Barrier edge with\\nall ten fingers frost-bitten. They did not really come back until we were\\nin the tent for our night meal, and within a few hours there were two or\\nthree large blisters, up to an inch long, on all of them. For many days\\nthose blisters hurt frightfully.\\nWe were camped that night about half a mile in from the Barrier edge. The\\ntemperature was -56\xb0. We had a baddish time, being very glad to get out\\nof our shivering bags next morning (June 29). We began to suspect, as we\\nknew only too well later, that the only good time of the twenty-four\\nhours was breakfast, for then with reasonable luck we need not get into\\nour sleeping-bags again for another seventeen hours.\\n[Illustration: A PANORAMIC VIEW OF ROSS ISLAND FROM CRATER HILL]\\nThe horror of the nineteen days it took us to travel from Cape Evans to\\nCape Crozier would have to be re-experienced to be appreciated; and any\\none would be a fool who went again: it is not possible to describe it.\\nThe weeks which followed them were comparative bliss, not because later\\nour conditions were better--they were far worse--because we were\\ncallous. I for one had come to that point of suffering at which I did not\\nreally care if only I could die without much pain. They talk of the\\nheroism of the dying--they little know--it would be so easy to die, a\\ndose of morphia, a friendly crevasse, and blissful sleep. The trouble is\\nto go on....\\nIt was the darkness that did it. I don\'t believe minus seventy\\ntemperatures would be bad in daylight, not comparatively bad, when you\\ncould see where you were going, where you were stepping, where the sledge\\nstraps were, the cooker, the primus, the food; could see your footsteps\\nlately trodden deep into the soft snow that you might find your way back\\nto the rest of your load; could see the lashings of the food bags; could\\nread a compass without striking three or four different boxes to find one\\ndry match; could read your watch to see if the blissful moment of getting\\nout of your bag was come without groping in the snow all about; when it\\nwould not take you five minutes to lash up the door of the tent, and five\\nhours to get started in the morning....\\nBut in these days we were never less than four hours from the moment when\\nBill cried \\"Time to get up\\" to the time when we got into our harness. It\\ntook two men to get one man into his harness, and was all they could do,\\nfor the canvas was frozen and our clothes were frozen until sometimes not\\neven two men could bend them into the required shape.\\nThe trouble is sweat and breath. I never knew before how much of the\\nbody\'s waste comes out through the pores of the skin. On the most bitter\\ndays, when we had to camp before we had done a four-hour march in order\\nto nurse back our frozen feet, it seemed that we must be sweating. And\\nall this sweat, instead of passing away through the porous wool of our\\nclothing and gradually drying off us, froze and accumulated. It passed\\njust away from our flesh and then became ice: we shook plenty of snow and\\nice down from inside our trousers every time we changed our foot-gear,\\nand we could have shaken it from our vests and from between our vests and\\nshirts, but of course we could not strip to this extent. But when we got\\ninto our sleeping-bags, if we were fortunate, we became warm enough\\nduring the night to thaw this ice: part remained in our clothes, part\\npassed into the skins of our sleeping-bags, and soon both were sheets of\\narmour-plate.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.03","output":"The passage describes the challenges faced by explorers camping in extreme cold conditions including the freezing of breath, frostbite, and the difficulty of movement.

The trouble really began in your\\nsleeping-bag, for it was far too cold to keep a hole open through which\\nto breathe.

We had had our\\nbreakfast, struggled into our foot-gear, and squared up inside the tent,\\nwhich was comparatively warm. Once outside, I raised my head to look\\nround and found I could not move it back. My clothing had frozen hard as\\nI stood--perhaps fifteen seconds.

Henceforward it was common for one or other of\\nus to leave the other two to continue the camp work while he stamped\\nabout in the snow, beat his arms, or nursed some exposed part. But we\\ncould not restore the circulation of our feet like this--the only way\\nthen was to camp and get some hot water into ourselves before we took our\\nfoot-gear off. The difficulty was to know whether our feet were frozen or\\nnot, for the only thing we knew for certain was that we had lost all\\nfeeling in them. Wilson\'s knowledge as a doctor came in here: many a time\\nhe had to decide from our descriptions of our feet whether to camp or to\\ngo on for another hour. A wrong decision meant disaster, for if one of us\\nhad been crippled the whole party would have been placed in great\\ndifficulties. Probably we should all have died.\\nOn June 29 the temperature was -50\xb0 all day and there was sometimes a\\nlight breeze which was inclined to frost-bite our faces and hands. Owing\\nto the weight of our two sledges and the bad surface our pace was not\\nmore than a slow and very heavy plod: at our lunch camp Wilson had the\\nheel and sole of one foot frost-bitten, and I had two big toes. Bowers\\nwas never worried by frost-bitten feet.\\nThat night was very cold, the temperature falling to -66\xb0, and it was\\n-55\xb0 at breakfast on June 30. We had not shipped the eider-down linings\\nto our sleeping-bags, in order to keep them dry as long as possible. My\\nown fur bag was too big for me, and throughout this journey was more\\ndifficult to thaw out than the other two: on the other hand, it never\\nsplit, as did Bill\'s.\\nWe were now getting into that cold bay which lies between the Hut Point\\nPeninsula and Terror Point. It was known from old Discovery days that the\\nBarrier winds are deflected from this area, pouring out into McMurdo\\nSound behind us, and into the Ross Sea at Cape Crozier in front. In\\nconsequence of the lack of high winds the surface of the snow is never\\nswept and hardened and polished as elsewhere: it was now a mass of the\\nhardest and smallest snow crystals, to pull through which in cold\\ntemperatures was just like pulling through sand. I have spoken elsewhere\\nof Barrier surfaces, and how, when the cold is very great, sledge runners\\ncannot melt the crystal points but only advance by rolling them over and\\nover upon one another. That was the surface we met on this journey, and\\nin soft snow the effect is accentuated. Our feet were sinking deep at\\nevery step.\\nAnd so when we tried to start on June 30 we found we could not move both\\nsledges together. There was nothing for it but to take one on at a time\\nand come back for the other. This has often been done in daylight when\\nthe only risks run are those of blizzards which may spring up suddenly\\nand obliterate tracks. Now in darkness it was more complicated. From 11\\nA.M. to 3 P.M. there was enough light to see the big holes made by our\\nfeet, and we took on one sledge, trudged back in our tracks, and brought\\non the second. Bowers used to toggle and untoggle our harnesses when we\\nchanged sledges. Of course in this relay work we covered three miles in\\ndistance for every one mile forward, and even the single sledges were\\nvery hard pulling. When we lunched the temperature was -61\xb0. After lunch\\nthe little light had gone, and we carried a naked lighted candle back\\nwith us when we went to find our second sledge. It was the weirdest kind\\nof procession, three frozen men and a little pool of light. Generally we\\nsteered by Jupiter, and I never see him now without recalling his\\nfriendship in those days.\\nWe were very silent, it was not very easy to talk: but sledging is always\\na silent business. I remember a long discussion which began just now\\nabout cold snaps--was this the normal condition of the Barrier, or was it\\na cold snap?--what constituted a cold snap? The discussion lasted about a\\nweek. Do things slowly, always slowly, that was the burden of Wilson\'s\\nleadership: and every now and then the question, Shall we go on? and the\\nanswer Yes. \\"I think we are all right as long as our appetites are good,\\"\\nsaid Bill. Always patient, self-possessed, unruffled, he was the only man\\non earth, as I believe, who could have led this journey.\\nThat day we made 3\xbc miles, and travelled 10 miles to do it. The\\ntemperature was -66\xb0 when we camped, and we were already pretty badly\\niced up. That was the last night I lay (I had written slept) in my big\\nreindeer bag without the lining of eider-down which we each carried. For\\nme it was a very bad night: a succession of shivering fits which I was\\nquite unable to stop, and which took possession of my body for many\\nminutes at a time until I thought my back would break, such was the\\nstrain placed upon it. They talk of chattering teeth: but when your body\\nchatters you may call yourself cold. I can only compare the strain to\\nthat which I have been unfortunate enough to see in a case of lock-jaw.\\nOne of my big toes was frost-bitten, but I do not know for how long.\\nWilson was fairly comfortable in his smaller bag, and Bowers was snoring\\nloudly. The minimum temperature that night as taken under the sledge was\\n-69\xb0; and as taken on the sledge was -75\xb0. That is a hundred and seven\\ndegrees of frost.\\nWe did the same relay work on July 1, but found the pulling still harder;\\nand it was all that we could do to move the one sledge forward. From now\\nonwards Wilson and I, but not to the same extent Bowers, experienced a\\ncurious optical delusion when returning in our tracks for the second\\nsledge. I have said that we found our way back by the light of a candle,\\nand we found it necessary to go back in our same footprints. These holes\\nbecame to our tired brains not depressions but elevations: hummocks over\\nwhich we stepped, raising our feet painfully and draggingly. And then we\\nremembered, and said what fools we were, and for a while we compelled\\nourselves to walk through these phantom hills. But it was no lasting\\ngood, and as the days passed we realized that we must suffer this\\nabsurdity, for we could not do anything else. But of course it took it\\nout of us.\\nDuring these days the blisters on my fingers were very painful. Long\\nbefore my hands were frost-bitten, or indeed anything but cold, which was\\nof course a normal thing, the matter inside these big blisters, which\\nrose all down my fingers with only a skin between them, was frozen into\\nice. To handle the cooking gear or the food bags was agony; to start the\\nprimus was worse; and when, one day, I was able to prick six or seven of\\nthe blisters after supper and let the liquid matter out, the relief was\\nvery great. Every night after that I treated such others as were ready in\\nthe same way until they gradually disappeared. Sometimes it was difficult\\nnot to howl.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.04","output":"Summary: The narrator describes the extreme cold temperatures and harsh conditions they face on their journey to the South Pole.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"Our conditions forced themselves upon us without pause: it was not possible to think of anything else.\\"\\n\\nExcerpt 2: \\"We got into some strange knots when trying to persuade our limbs into our bags, and suffered terribly from cramp in consequence.\\"\\n\\nText_to_image: An image of a person vigorously rubbing their hands together to warm them up before lighting a match to start a fire, with a box of matches and a candle nearby, set against a backdrop of a dark, cold, and snowy landscape.","parsed":{"summary":"Summary: The narrator describes the extreme cold temperatures and harsh conditions they face on their journey to the South Pole.","excerpt_1":"\\"Our conditions forced themselves upon us without pause: it was not possible to think of anything else.\\"","excerpt_2":"\\"We got into some strange knots when trying to persuade our limbs into our bags, and suffered terribly from cramp in consequence.\\"","text_to_image":"An image of a person vigorously rubbing their hands together to warm them up before lighting a match to start a fire, with a box of matches and a candle nearby, set against a backdrop of a dark, cold, and snowy landscape."},"passage":"I _did_ want to howl many times every hour of these days and nights, but\\nI invented a formula instead, which I repeated to myself continually.\\nEspecially, I remember, it came in useful when at the end of the march\\nwith my feet frost-bitten, my heart beating slowly, my vitality at its\\nlowest ebb, my body solid with cold, I used to seize the shovel and go on\\ndigging snow on to the tent skirting while the cook inside was trying to\\nlight the primus. \\"You\'ve got it in the neck--stick it--stick it--you\'ve\\ngot it in the neck,\\" was the refrain, and I wanted every little bit of\\nencouragement it would give me: then I would find myself repeating \\"Stick\\nit--stick it--stick it--stick it,\\" and then \\"You\'ve got it in the neck.\\"\\nOne of the joys of summer sledging is that you can let your mind wander\\nthousands of miles away for weeks and weeks. Oates used to provision his\\nlittle yacht (there was a pickled herring he was going to have): I\\ninvented the compactest little revolving bookcase which was going to hold\\nnot books, but pemmican and chocolate and biscuit and cocoa and sugar,\\nand have a cooker on the top, and was going to stand always ready to\\nquench my hunger when I got home: and we visited restaurants and theatres\\nand grouse moors, and we thought of a pretty girl, or girls, and.... But\\nnow that was all impossible. Our conditions forced themselves upon us\\nwithout pause: it was not possible to think of anything else. We got no\\nrespite. I found it best to refuse to let myself think of the past or the\\nfuture--to live only for the job of the moment, and to compel myself to\\nthink only how to do it most efficiently. Once you let yourself\\nimagine....\\nThis day also (July 1) we were harassed by a nasty little wind which blew\\nin our faces. The temperature was -66\xb0, and in such temperatures the\\neffect of even the lightest airs is blighting, and immediately freezes\\nany exposed part. But we all fitted the bits of wind-proof lined with\\nfur which we had made in the hut, across our balaclavas in front of our\\nnoses, and these were of the greatest comfort. They formed other places\\nupon which our breath could freeze, and the lower parts of our faces were\\nsoon covered with solid sheets of ice, which was in itself an additional\\nprotection. This was a normal and not uncomfortable condition during the\\njourney: the hair on our faces kept the ice away from the skin, and for\\nmyself I would rather have the ice than be without it, until I want to\\nget my balaclava off to drink my hoosh. We only made 2\xbc miles, and it\\ntook 8 hours.\\nIt blew force 3 that night with a temperature of -65.2\xb0, and there was\\nsome drift. This was pretty bad, but luckily the wind dropped to a light\\nbreeze by the time we were ready to start the next morning (July 2). The\\ntemperature was then -60\xb0, and continued so all day, falling lower in the\\nevening. At 4 P.M. we watched a bank of fog form over the peninsula to\\nour left and noticed at the same time that our frozen mitts thawed out on\\nour hands, and the outlines of the land as shown by the stars became\\nobscured. We made 2\xbd miles with the usual relaying, and camped at 8 P.M.\\nwith the temperature -65\xb0. It really was a terrible march, and parts of\\nboth my feet were frozen at lunch. After supper I pricked six or seven of\\nthe worst blisters, and the relief was considerable.\\nI have met with amusement people who say, \\"Oh, we had minus fifty\\ntemperatures in Canada; they didn\'t worry _me_,\\" or \\"I\'ve been down to\\nminus sixty something in Siberia.\\" And then you find that they had nice\\ndry clothing, a nice night\'s sleep in a nice aired bed, and had just\\nwalked out after lunch for a few minutes from a nice warm hut or an\\noverheated train. And they look back upon it as an experience to be\\nremembered. Well! of course as an experience of cold this can only be\\ncompared to eating a vanilla ice with hot chocolate cream after an\\nexcellent dinner at Claridge\'s. But in our present state we began to look\\nupon minus fifties as a luxury which we did not often get.\\nThat evening, for the first time, we discarded our naked candle in\\nfavour of the rising moon. We had started before the moon on purpose, but\\nas we shall see she gave us little light. However, we owed our escape\\nfrom a very sticky death to her on one occasion.\\nIt was a little later on when we were among crevasses, with Terror above\\nus, but invisible, somewhere on our left, and the Barrier pressure on our\\nright. We were quite lost in the darkness, and only knew that we were\\nrunning downhill, the sledge almost catching our heels. There had been no\\nlight all day, clouds obscured the moon, we had not seen her since\\nyesterday. And quite suddenly a little patch of clear sky drifted, as it\\nwere, over her face, and she showed us three paces ahead a great crevasse\\nwith just a shining icy lid not much thicker than glass. We should all\\nhave walked into it, and the sledge would certainly have followed us\\ndown. After that I felt we had a chance of pulling through: God could not\\nbe so cruel as to have saved us just to prolong our agony.\\nBut at present we need not worry about crevasses; for we had not reached\\nthe long stretch where the moving Barrier, with the weight of many\\nhundred miles of ice behind it, comes butting up against the slopes of\\nMount Terror, itself some eleven thousand feet high. Now we were still\\nplunging ankle-deep in the mass of soft sandy snow which lies in the\\nwindless area. It seemed to have no bottom at all, and since the snow was\\nmuch the same temperature as the air, our feet, as well as our bodies,\\ngot colder and colder the longer we marched: in ordinary sledging you\\nbegin to warm up after a quarter of an hour\'s pulling, here it was just\\nthe reverse. Even now I find myself unconsciously kicking the toes of my\\nright foot against the heel of my left: a habit I picked up on this\\njourney by doing it every time we halted. Well no. Not always. For there\\nwas one halt when we just lay on our backs and gazed up into the sky,\\nwhere, so the others said, there was blazing the most wonderful aurora\\nthey had ever seen. I did not see it, being so near-sighted and unable to\\nwear spectacles owing to the cold. The aurora was always before us as we\\ntravelled east, more beautiful than any seen by previous expeditions\\nwintering in McMurdo Sound, where Erebus must have hidden the most\\nbrilliant displays. Now most of the sky was covered with swinging,\\nswaying curtains which met in a great whirl overhead: lemon yellow, green\\nand orange.\\nThe minimum this night was -65\xb0, and during July 3 it ranged between -52\xb0\\nand -58\xb0. We got forward only 2\xbd miles, and by this time I had silently\\nmade up my mind that we had not the ghost of a chance of reaching the\\npenguins. I am sure that Bill was having a very bad time these nights,\\nthough it was an impression rather than anything else, for he never said\\nso. We knew we did sleep, for we heard one another snore, and also we\\nused to have dreams and nightmares; but we had little consciousness of\\nit, and we were now beginning to drop off when we halted on the march.\\nOur sleeping-bags were getting really bad by now, and already it took a\\nlong time to thaw a way down into them at night. Bill spread his in the\\nmiddle, Bowers was on his right, and I was on his left. Always he\\ninsisted that I should start getting my legs into mine before _he_\\nstarted: we were rapidly cooling down after our hot supper, and this was\\nvery unselfish of him. Then came seven shivering hours and first thing on\\ngetting out of our sleeping-bags in the morning we stuffed our personal\\ngear into the mouth of the bag before it could freeze: this made a plug\\nwhich when removed formed a frozen hole for us to push into as a start in\\nthe evening.\\nWe got into some strange knots when trying to persuade our limbs into our\\nbags, and suffered terribly from cramp in consequence. We would wait and\\nrub, but directly we tried to move again down it would come and grip our\\nlegs in a vice. We also, especially Bowers, suffered agony from cramp in\\nthe stomach. We let the primus burn on after supper now for a time--it\\nwas the only thing which kept us going--and when one who was holding the\\nprimus was seized with cramp we hastily took the lamp from him until the\\nspasm was over. It was horrible to see Birdie\'s stomach cramp sometimes:\\nhe certainly got it much worse than Bill or I. I suffered a lot from\\nheartburn especially in my bag at nights: we were eating a great\\nproportion of fat and this was probably the cause. Stupidly I said\\nnothing about it for a long time. Later when Bill found out, he soon made\\nit better with the medical case.\\nBirdie always lit the candle in the morning--so called and this was an\\nheroic business. Moisture collected on our matches if you looked at them.\\nPartly I suppose it was bringing them from outside into a comparatively\\nwarm tent; partly from putting boxes into pockets in our clothing.\\nSometimes it was necessary to try four or five boxes before a match\\nstruck. The temperature of the boxes and matches was about a hundred\\ndegrees of frost, and the smallest touch of the metal on naked flesh\\ncaused a frost-bite. If you wore mitts you could scarcely feel\\nanything--especially since the tips of our fingers were already very\\ncallous. To get the first light going in the morning was a beastly cold\\nbusiness, made worse by having to make sure that it was at last time to\\nget up. Bill insisted that we must lie in our bags seven hours every\\nnight.\\nIn civilization men are taken at their own valuation because there are so\\nmany ways of concealment, and there is so little time, perhaps even so\\nlittle understanding. Not so down South. These two men went through the\\nWinter Journey and lived: later they went through the Polar Journey and\\ndied. They were gold, pure, shining, unalloyed.

Wilson, del.]\\nThere are those who write of Polar Expeditions as though the whole\\nthing was as easy as possible. They are trusting, I suspect, in a public\\nwho will say, \\"What a fine fellow this is! we know what horrors he has\\nendured, yet see, how little he makes of all his difficulties and\\nhardships.\\" Others have gone to the opposite extreme. I do not know that\\nthere is any use in trying to make a -18\xb0 temperature appear formidable\\nto an uninitiated reader by calling it fifty degrees of frost. I want to\\ndo neither of these things. I am not going to pretend that this was\\nanything but a ghastly journey, made bearable and even pleasant to look\\nback upon by the qualities of my two companions who have gone. At the\\nsame time I have no wish to make it appear more horrible than it actually\\nwas: the reader need not fear that I am trying to exaggerate.\\nDuring the night of July 3 the temperature dropped to -65\xb0, but in the\\nmorning we wakened (we really did wake that morning) to great relief. The\\ntemperature was only -27\xb0 with the wind blowing some 15 miles an hour\\nwith steadily falling snow. It only lasted a few hours, and we knew it\\nmust be blowing a howling blizzard outside the windless area in which we\\nlay, but it gave us time to sleep and rest, and get thoroughly thawed,\\nand wet, and warm, inside our sleeping-bags. To me at any rate this\\nmodified blizzard was a great relief, though we all knew that our gear\\nwould be worse than ever when the cold came back. It was quite impossible\\nto march. During the course of the day the temperature dropped to -44\xb0:\\nduring the following night to -54\xb0.\\nThe soft new snow which had fallen made the surface the next day (July 5)\\nalmost impossible. We relayed as usual, and managed to do eight hours\'\\npulling, but we got forward only 1\xbd miles. The temperature ranged between\\n-55\xb0 and -61\xb0, and there was at one time a considerable breeze, the\\neffect of which was paralysing. There was the great circle of a halo\\nround the moon with a vertical shaft, and mock moons. We hoped that we\\nwere rising on to the long snow cape which marks the beginning of Mount\\nTerror. That night the temperature was -75\xb0; at breakfast -70\xb0; at noon\\nnearly -77\xb0. The day lives in my memory as that on which I found out\\nthat records are not worth making. The thermometer as swung by Bowers\\nafter lunch at 5.51 P.M. registered -77.5\xb0, which is 109\xbd degrees of\\nfrost, and is I suppose as cold as any one will want to endure in\\ndarkness and iced-up gear and clothes. The lowest temperature recorded by\\na Discovery Spring Journey party was -67.7\xb0,[151] and in those days\\nfourteen days was a long time for a Spring Party to be away sledging and\\nthey were in daylight. This was our tenth day out and we hoped to be away\\nfor six weeks.\\nLuckily we were spared wind. Our naked candle burnt steadily as we\\ntrudged back in our tracks to fetch our other sledge, but if we touched\\nmetal for a fraction of a second with naked fingers we were frost-bitten.\\nTo fasten the strap buckles over the loaded sledge was difficult: to\\nhandle the cooker, or mugs, or spoons, the primus or oil can was worse.\\nHow Bowers managed with the meteorological instruments I do not know, but\\nthe meteorological log is perfectly kept. Yet as soon as you breathed\\nnear the paper it was covered with a film of ice through which the pencil\\nwould not bite. To handle rope was always cold and in these very low\\ntemperatures dreadfully cold work. The toggling up of our harnesses to\\nthe sledge we were about to pull, the untoggling at the end of the stage,\\nthe lashing up of our sleeping-bags in the morning, the fastening of the\\ncooker to the top of the instrument box, were bad, but not nearly so bad\\nas the smaller lashings which were now strings of ice. One of the worst\\nwas round the weekly food bag, and those round the pemmican, tea and\\nbutter bags inside were thinner still. But the real devil was the lashing\\nof the tent door: it was like wire, and yet had to be tied tight. If you\\nhad to get out of the tent during the seven hours spent in our\\nsleeping-bags you must tie a string as stiff as a poker, and re-thaw your\\nway into a bag already as hard as a board. Our paraffin was supplied at a\\nflash point suitable to low temperatures and was only a little milky: it\\nwas very difficult to splinter bits off the butter.\\nThe temperature that night was -75.8\xb0, and I will not pretend that it did\\nnot convince me that Dante was right when he placed the circles of ice\\nbelow the circles of fire. Still we slept sometimes, and always we lay\\nfor seven hours. Again and again Bill asked us how about going back, and\\nalways we said no. Yet there was nothing I should have liked better: I\\nwas quite sure that to dream of Cape Crozier was the wildest lunacy. That\\nday we had advanced 1\xbd miles by the utmost labour, and the usual relay\\nwork. This was quite a good march--and Cape Crozier is 67 miles from Cape\\nEvans!\\nMore than once in my short life I have been struck by the value of the\\nman who is blind to what appears to be a common-sense certainty: he\\nachieves the impossible. We never spoke our thoughts: we discussed the\\nAge of Stone which was to come, when we built our cosy warm rock hut on\\nthe slopes of Mount Terror, and ran our stove with penguin blubber, and\\npickled little Emperors in warmth and dryness. We were quite intelligent\\npeople, and we must all have known that we were not going to see the\\npenguins and that it was folly to go forward. And yet with quiet\\nperseverance, in perfect friendship, almost with gentleness those two men\\nled on. I just did what I was told.\\nIt is desirable that the body should work, feed and sleep at regular\\nhours, and this is too often forgotten when sledging. But just now we\\nfound we were unable to fit 8 hours marching and 7 hours in our\\nsleeping-bags into a 24-hour day: the routine camp work took more than 9\\nhours, such were the conditions. We therefore ceased to observe the quite\\nimaginary difference between night and day, and it was noon on Friday\\n(July 7) before we got away. The temperature was -68\xb0 and there was a\\nthick white fog: generally we had but the vaguest idea where we were, and\\nwe camped at 10 P.M. after managing 1\xbe miles for the day. But what a\\nrelief. Instead of labouring away, our hearts were beating more\\nnaturally: it was easier to camp, we had some feeling in our hands, and\\nour feet had not gone to sleep. Birdie swung the thermometer and found\\nit only -55\xb0. \\"Now if we tell people that to get only 87 degrees of frost\\ncan be an enormous relief they simply won\'t believe us,\\" I remember\\nsaying. Perhaps you won\'t but it was, all the same: and I wrote that\\nnight: \\"There is something after all rather good in doing something never\\ndone before.\\" Things were looking up, you see.\\nOur hearts were doing very gallant work. Towards the end of the march\\nthey were getting beaten and were finding it difficult to pump the blood\\nout to our extremities. There were few days that Wilson and I did not get\\nsome part of our feet frost-bitten. As we camped, I suspect our hearts\\nwere beating comparatively slowly and weakly. Nothing could be done until\\na hot drink was ready--tea for lunch, hot water for supper. Directly we\\nstarted to drink then the effect was wonderful: it was, said Wilson, like\\nputting a hot-water bottle against your heart. The beats became very\\nrapid and strong and you felt the warmth travelling outwards and\\ndownwards. Then you got your foot-gear off--puttees (cut in half and\\nwound round the bottom of the trousers), finnesko, saennegrass, hair\\nsocks, and two pairs of woollen socks. Then you nursed back your feet and\\ntried to believe you were glad--a frost-bite does not hurt until it\\nbegins to thaw. Later came the blisters, and then the chunks of dead\\nskin.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.06","output":"The passage describes the difficult journey of men trying to cross the Barrier to reach the Emperor penguin rookery in Cape Crozier.

He kept on\\nsaying that he was sorry, but he had never dreamed it was going to be as\\nbad as this. He felt that having asked us to come he was in some way\\nchargeable with our troubles. When leaders have this kind of feeling\\nabout their men they get much better results, if the men are good: if men\\nare bad or even moderate they will try and take advantage of what they\\nconsider to be softness.\\nThe temperature on the night of July 7 was -59\xb0.\\nOn July 8 we found the first sign that we might be coming to an end of\\nthis soft, powdered, arrowrooty snow. It was frightfully hard pulling;\\nbut every now and then our finnesko pierced a thin crust before they sank\\nright in. This meant a little wind, and every now and then our feet came\\ndown on a hard slippery patch under the soft snow. We were surrounded by\\nfog which walked along with us, and far above us the moon was shining on\\nits roof. Steering was as difficult as the pulling, and four hours of the\\nhardest work only produced 1\xbc miles in the morning, and three more hours\\n1 mile in the afternoon--and the temperature was -57\xb0 with a\\nbreeze--horrible!\\nIn the early morning of the next day snow began to fall and the fog was\\ndense: when we got up we could see nothing at all anywhere. After the\\nusual four hours to get going in the morning we settled that it was\\nimpossible to relay, for we should never be able to track ourselves back\\nto the second sledge. It was with very great relief that we found we\\ncould move both sledges together, and I think this was mainly due to the\\ntemperature which had risen to -36\xb0.\\nThis was our fourth day of fog in addition to the normal darkness, and we\\nknew we must be approaching the land. It would be Terror Point, and the\\nfog is probably caused by the moist warm air coming up from the sea\\nthrough the pressure cracks and crevasses; for it is supposed that the\\nBarrier here is afloat.\\nI wish I could take you on to the great Ice Barrier some calm evening\\nwhen the sun is just dipping in the middle of the night and show you the\\nautumn tints on Ross Island. A last look round before turning in, a good\\nday\'s march behind, enough fine fat pemmican inside you to make you\\nhappy, the homely smell of tobacco from the tent, a pleasant sense of\\nsoft fur and the deep sleep to come. And all the softest colours God has\\nmade are in the snow; on Erebus to the west, where the wind can scarcely\\nmove his cloud of smoke; and on Terror to the east, not so high, and more\\nregular in form. How peaceful and dignified it all is.\\nThat was what you might have seen four months ago had you been out on the\\nBarrier plain. Low down on the extreme right or east of the land there\\nwas a black smudge of rock peeping out from great snow-drifts: that was\\nthe Knoll, and close under it were the cliffs of Cape Crozier, the Knoll\\nlooking quite low and the cliffs invisible, although they are eight\\nhundred feet high, a sheer precipice falling to the sea.\\nIt is at Cape Crozier that the Barrier edge, which runs for four hundred\\nmiles as an ice-cliff up to 200 feet high, meets the land. The Barrier is\\nmoving against this land at a rate which is sometimes not much less than\\na mile in a year. Perhaps you can imagine the chaos which it piles up:\\nthere are pressure ridges compared to which the waves of the sea are like\\na ploughed field. These are worst at Cape Crozier itself, but they extend\\nall along the southern slopes of Mount Terror, running parallel with the\\nland, and the disturbance which Cape Crozier makes is apparent at Corner\\nCamp some forty miles back on the Barrier in the crevasses we used to\\nfind and the occasional ridges we had to cross.\\nIn the Discovery days the pressure just where it hit Cape Crozier formed\\na small bay, and on the sea-ice frozen in this bay the men of the\\nDiscovery found the only Emperor penguin rookery which had ever been\\nseen. The ice here was not blown out by the blizzards which cleared the\\nRoss Sea, and open water or open leads were never far away. This gave the\\nEmperors a place to lay their eggs and an opportunity to find their food.\\nWe had therefore to find our way along the pressure to the Knoll, and\\nthence penetrate _through_ the pressure to the Emperors\' Bay. And we had\\nto do it in the dark.\\nTerror Point, which we were approaching in the fog, is a short twenty\\nmiles from the Knoll, and ends in a long snow-tongue running out into the\\nBarrier. The way had been travelled a good many times in Discovery days\\nand in daylight, and Wilson knew there was a narrow path, free from\\ncrevasses, which skirted along between the mountain and the pressure\\nridges running parallel to it. But it is one thing to walk along a\\ncorridor by day, and quite another to try to do so at night, especially\\nwhen there are no walls by which you can correct your course--only\\ncrevasses. Anyway, Terror Point must be somewhere close to us now, and\\nvaguely in front of us was that strip of snow, neither Barrier nor\\nmountain, which was our only way forward.\\nWe began to realize, now that our eyes were more or less out of action,\\nhow much we could do with our feet and ears. The effect of walking in\\nfinnesko is much the same as walking in gloves, and you get a sense of\\ntouch which nothing else except bare feet could give you. Thus we could\\nfeel every small variation in surface, every crust through which our feet\\nbroke, every hardened patch below the soft snow. And soon we began to\\nrely more and more upon the sound of our footsteps to tell us whether we\\nwere on crevasses or solid ground. From now onwards we were working among\\ncrevasses fairly constantly. I loathe them in full daylight when much can\\nbe done to avoid them, and when if you fall into them you can at any rate\\nsee where the sides are, which way they run and how best to scramble out;\\nwhen your companions can see how to stop the sledge to which you are all\\nattached by your harness; how most safely to hold the sledge when\\nstopped; how, if you are dangling fifteen feet down in a chasm, to work\\nabove you to get you up to the surface again. And then our clothes were\\ngenerally something like clothes. Even under the ideal conditions of good\\nlight, warmth and no wind, crevasses are beastly, whether you are pulling\\nover a level and uniform snow surface, never knowing what moment will\\nfind you dropping into some bottomless pit, or whether you are rushing\\nfor the Alpine rope and the sledge, to help some companion who has\\ndisappeared. I dream sometimes now of bad days we had on the Beardmore\\nand elsewhere, when men were dropping through to be caught up and hang at\\nthe full length of the harnesses and toggles many times in an hour. On\\nthe same sledge as myself on the Beardmore one man went down once head\\nfirst, and another eight times to the length of his harness in 25\\nminutes. And always you wondered whether your harness was going to hold\\nwhen the jerk came. But those days were a Sunday School treat compared to\\nour days of blind-man\'s buff with the Emperor penguins among the\\ncrevasses of Cape Crozier.\\nOur troubles were greatly increased by the state of our clothes. If we\\nhad been dressed in lead we should have been able to move our arms and\\nnecks and heads more easily than we could now. If the same amount of\\nicing had extended to our legs I believe we should still be there,\\nstanding unable to move: but happily the forks of our trousers still\\nremained movable. To get into our canvas harnesses was the most absurd\\nbusiness. Quite in the early days of our journey we met with this\\ndifficulty, and somewhat foolishly decided not to take off our harness\\nfor lunch. The harnesses thawed in the tent, and froze back as hard as\\nboards. Likewise our clothing was hard as boards and stuck out from our\\nbodies in every imaginable fold and angle. To fit one board over the\\nother required the united efforts of the would-be wearer and his two\\ncompanions, and the process had to be repeated for each one of us twice a\\nday. Goodness knows how long it took; but it cannot have been less than\\nfive minutes\' thumping at each man.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.07","output":"{\'summary\': \'The explorers get lost in a blizzard, experience pressure ridges and changes in temperature, and revise their food rations during their winter journey.\', \'excerpt_1\': \'And then quite suddenly, vague, indefinable, monstrous, there\\\\nloomed a something ahead. ...\', \'excerpt_2\': \'We only brought\\\\npemmican, biscuit, butter and tea\', \'text_to_image\': \'Explorers walking up on ice pressure ridges, tied together, under a moonlit, foggy sky, trying to find their way through the blizzard snow and ice. \'}","parsed":{"summary":"The explorers get lost in a blizzard, experience pressure ridges and changes in temperature, and revise their food rations during their winter journey.","excerpt_1":"And then quite suddenly, vague, indefinable, monstrous, there loomed a something ahead. ...","excerpt_2":"We only brought pemmican, biscuit, butter and tea","text_to_image":"Explorers walking up on ice pressure ridges, tied together, under a moonlit, foggy sky, trying to find their way through the blizzard snow and ice. "},"passage":"As we approached Terror Point in the fog we sensed that we had risen and\\nfallen over several rises. Every now and then we felt hard slippery snow\\nunder our feet. Every now and then our feet went through crusts in the\\nsurface. And then quite suddenly, vague, indefinable, monstrous, there\\nloomed a something ahead. I remember having a feeling as of ghosts about\\nas we untoggled our harnesses from the sledge, tied them together, and\\nthus roped walked upwards on that ice. The moon was showing a ghastly\\nragged mountainous edge above us in the fog, and as we rose we found that\\nwe were on a pressure ridge. We stopped, looked at one another, and then\\n_bang_--right under our feet. More bangs, and creaks and groans; for that\\nice was moving and splitting like glass. The cracks went off all round\\nus, and some of them ran along for hundreds of yards. Afterwards we got\\nused to it, but at first the effect was very jumpy. From first to last\\nduring this journey we had plenty of variety and none of that monotony\\nwhich is inevitable in sledging over long distances of Barrier in summer.\\nOnly the long shivering fits following close one after the other all the\\ntime we lay in our dreadful sleeping-bags, hour after hour and night\\nafter night in those temperatures--they were as monotonous as could be.\\nLater we got frost-bitten even as we lay in our sleeping-bags. Things are\\ngetting pretty bad when you get frost-bitten in your bag.\\nThere was only a glow where the moon was; we stood in a moonlit fog, and\\nthis was sufficient to show the edge of another ridge ahead, and yet\\nanother on our left. We were utterly bewildered. The deep booming of the\\nice continued, and it may be that the tide has something to do with this,\\nthough we were many miles from the ordinary coastal ice. We went back,\\ntoggled up to our sledges again and pulled in what we thought was the\\nright direction, always with that feeling that the earth may open\\nunderneath your feet which you have in crevassed areas. But all we found\\nwere more mounds and banks of snow and ice, into which we almost ran\\nbefore we saw them. We were clearly lost. It was near midnight, and I\\nwrote, \\"it may be the pressure ridges or it may be Terror, it is\\nimpossible to say,--and I should think it is impossible to move till it\\nclears. We were steering N.E. when we got here and returned S.W. till we\\nseemed to be in a hollow and camped.\\"\\nThe temperature had been rising from -36\xb0 at 11 A.M. and it was now -27\xb0;\\nsnow was falling and nothing whatever could be seen. From under the tent\\ncame noises as though some giant was banging a big empty tank. All the\\nsigns were for a blizzard, and indeed we had not long finished our supper\\nand were thawing our way little by little into our bags when the wind\\ncame away from the south. Before it started we got a glimpse of black\\nrock and knew we must be in the pressure ridges where they nearly join\\nMount Terror.\\nIt is with great surprise that in looking up the records I find that\\nblizzard lasted three days, the temperature and wind both rising till it\\nwas +9\xb0 and blowing force 9 on the morning of the second day (July 11).\\nOn the morning of the third day (July 12) it was blowing storm force\\n(10). The temperature had thus risen over eighty degrees.\\nIt was not an uncomfortable time. Wet and warm, the risen temperature\\nallowed all our ice to turn to water, and we lay steaming and beautifully\\nliquid, and wondered sometimes what we should be like when our gear froze\\nup once more. But we did not do much wondering, I suspect: we slept. From\\nthat point of view these blizzards were a perfect Godsend.\\nWe also revised our food rations. From the moment we started to prepare\\nfor this journey we were asked by Scott to try certain experiments in\\nview of the Plateau stage of the Polar Journey the following summer. It\\nwas supposed that the Plateau stage would be the really tough part of the\\nPolar Journey, and no one then dreamed that harder conditions could be\\nfound in the middle of the Barrier in March than on the Plateau, ten\\nthousand feet higher, in February. In view of the extreme conditions we\\nknew we must meet on this winter journey, far harder of course in point\\nof weather than anything experienced on the Polar Journey, we had\\ndetermined to simplify our food to the last degree. We only brought\\npemmican, biscuit, butter and tea: and tea is not a food, only a pleasant\\nstimulant, and hot: the pemmican was excellent and came from Beauvais,\\nCopenhagen.\\n[Illustration: CAMP WORK IN A BLIZZARD, PASSING IN THE COOKER--E. A.\\nWilson, del.]\\nThe immediate advantage of this was that we had few food bags to handle\\nfor each meal. If the air temperature is 100 degrees of frost, then\\neverything in the air is about 100 degrees of frost too. You have only to\\nuntie the lashings of one bag in a -70\xb0 temperature, with your feet\\nfrozen and your fingers just nursed back after getting a match to strike\\nfor the candle (you will have tried several boxes--metal), to realize\\nthis as an advantage.\\nThe immediate and increasingly pressing disadvantage is that you have no\\nsugar. Have you ever had a craving for sugar which never leaves you, even\\nwhen asleep? It is unpleasant. As a matter of fact the craving for sweet\\nthings never seriously worried us on this journey, and there must have\\nbeen some sugar in our biscuits which gave a pleasant sweetness to our\\nmid-day tea or nightly hot water when broken up and soaked in it. These\\nbiscuits were specially made for us by Huntley and Palmer: their\\ncomposition was worked out by Wilson and that firm\'s chemist, and is a\\nsecret. But they are probably the most satisfying biscuit ever made, and\\nI doubt whether they can be improved upon. There were two kinds, called\\nEmergency and Antarctic, but there was I think little difference between\\nthem except in the baking. A well-baked biscuit was good to eat when\\nsledging if your supply of food was good: but if you were very hungry an\\nunderbaked one was much preferred. By taking individually different\\nquantities of biscuit, pemmican and butter we were able roughly to test\\nthe proportions of proteids, fats and carbo-hydrates wanted by the human\\nbody under such extreme circumstances. Bill was all for fat, starting\\nwith 8 oz. butter, 12 oz. pemmican and only 12 oz. biscuit a day. Bowers\\ntold me he was going for proteids, 16 oz. pemmican and 16 oz. biscuit,\\nand suggested I should go the whole hog on carbo-hydrates. I did not like\\nthis, since I knew I should want more fat, but the rations were to be\\naltered as necessary during the journey, so there was no harm in trying.\\nSo I started with 20 oz. of biscuit and 12 oz. of pemmican a day.\\nBowers was all right (this was usual with him), but he did not eat all\\nhis extra pemmican. Bill could not eat all his extra butter, but was\\nsatisfied. I got hungry, certainly got more frost-bitten than the\\nothers, and wanted more fat. I also got heartburn. However, before taking\\nmore fat I increased my biscuits to 24 oz., but this did not satisfy me;\\nI wanted fat. Bill and I now took the same diet, he giving me 4 oz. of\\nbutter which he could not eat, and I giving him 4 oz. of biscuit which\\ndid not satisfy my wants. We both therefore had 12 oz. pemmican, 16 oz\\nbiscuit and 4 oz. butter a day, but we did not always finish our butter.\\nThis is an extremely good ration, and we had enough to eat during most of\\nthis journey. We certainly could not have faced the conditions without.\\nI will not say that I was entirely easy in my mind as we lay out that\\nblizzard somewhere off Terror Point; I don\'t know how the others were\\nfeeling. The unearthly banging going on underneath us may have had\\nsomething to do with it. But we were quite lost in the pressure and it\\nmight be the deuce and all to get out in the dark. The wind eddied and\\nswirled quite out of its usual straightforward way, and the tent got\\nbadly snowed up: our sledge had disappeared long ago. The position was\\nnot altogether a comfortable one.\\nTuesday night and Wednesday it blew up to force 10, temperature from -7\xb0\\nto +2\xb0. And then it began to modify and get squally. By 3 A.M. on\\nThursday (July 13) the wind had nearly ceased, the temperature was\\nfalling and the stars were shining through detached clouds. We were soon\\ngetting our breakfast, which always consisted of tea, followed by\\npemmican. We soaked our biscuits in both. Then we set to work to dig out\\nthe sledges and tent, a big job taking several hours. At last we got\\nstarted. In that jerky way in which I was still managing to jot a few\\nsentences down each night as a record, I wrote:\\n\\"Did 7\xbd miles during day--seems a marvellous run--rose and fell over\\nseveral ridges of Terror--in afternoon suddenly came on huge crevasse on\\none of these--we were quite high on Terror--moon saved us walking in--it\\nmight have taken sledge and all.\\"\\nTo do seven miles in a day, a distance which had taken us nearly a week\\nin the past, was very heartening. The temperature was between -20\xb0 and\\n-30\xb0 all day, and that was good too. When crossing the undulations which\\nran down out of the mountain into the true pressure ridges on our right\\nwe found that the wind which came down off the mountain struck along the\\ntop of the undulation, and flowing each way, caused a N.E. breeze on one\\nside and a N.W. breeze on the other. There seemed to be wind in the sky,\\nand the blizzard had not cleared as far away as we should have wished.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.08","output":"Summary: The explorers had used a lot of oil to stay warm and keep their primus lamps running, and their sleeping bags were difficult to thaw out for use.

Bill lengthened his trace out\\nwith the Alpine rope now and often afterwards so he found the crevasses\\nwell ahead of us and the sledge: nice for us but not so nice for Bill.\\nCrevasses in the dark _do_ put your nerves on edge.\\nWhen we started next morning (July 15) we could see on our left front and\\nmore or less on top of us the Knoll, which is a big hill whose\\nprecipitous cliffs to seaward form Cape Crozier. The sides of it sloped\\ndown towards us, and pressing against its ice-cliffs on ahead were miles\\nand miles of great pressure ridges, along which we had travelled, and\\nwhich hemmed us in. Mount Terror rose ten thousand feet high on our left,\\nand was connected with the Knoll by a great cup-like drift of\\nwind-polished snow. The slope of this in one place runs gently out on to\\nthe corridor along which we had sledged, and here we turned and started\\nto pull our sledges up. There were no crevasses, only the great drift of\\nsnow, so hard that we used our crampons just as though we had been on\\nice, and as polished as the china sides of a giant cup which it\\nresembled. For three miles we slogged up, until we were only 150 yards\\nfrom the moraine shelf where we were going to build our hut of rocks and\\nsnow. This moraine was above us on our left, the twin peaks of the Knoll\\nwere across the cup on our right; and here, 800 feet up the mountain\\nside, we pitched our last camp.\\nWe had arrived.\\nWhat should we call our hut? How soon could we get our clothes and bags\\ndry? How would the blubber stove work? Would the penguins be there? \\"It\\nseems too good to be true, 19 days out. Surely seldom has any one been so\\nwet; our bags hardly possible to get into, our wind-clothes just frozen\\nboxes. Birdie\'s patent balaclava is like iron--it is wonderful how our\\ncares have vanished.\\"[153]\\nIt was evening, but we were so keen to begin that we went straight up to\\nthe ridge above our camp, where the rock cropped out from the snow. We\\nfound that most of it was _in situ_ but that there were plenty of\\nboulders, some gravel, and of course any amount of the icy snow which\\nfell away below us down to our tent, and the great pressure about a mile\\nbeyond. Between us and that pressure, as we were to find out afterwards,\\nwas a great ice-cliff. The pressure ridges, and the Great Ice Barrier\\nbeyond, were at our feet; the Ross Sea edge but some four miles away. The\\nEmperors must be somewhere round that shoulder of the Knoll which hides\\nCape Crozier itself from our view.\\nOur scheme was to build an igloo with rock walls, banked up with snow,\\nusing a nine-foot sledge as a ridge beam, and a large sheet of green\\nWillesden canvas as a roof. We had also brought a board to form a lintel\\nover the door. Here with the stove, which was to be fed with blubber from\\nthe penguins, we were to have a comfortable warm home whence we would\\nmake excursions to the rookery perhaps four miles away. Perhaps we would\\nmanage to get our tent down to the rookery itself and do our scientific\\nwork there on the spot, leaving our nice hut for a night or more. That is\\nhow we planned it.\\nThat same night \\"we started to dig in under a great boulder on the top of\\nthe hill, hoping to make this a large part of one of the walls of the\\nhut, but the rock came close underneath and stopped us. We then chose a\\nmoderately level piece of moraine about twelve feet away, and just under\\nthe level of the top of the hill, hoping that here in the lee of the\\nridge we might escape a good deal of the tremendous winds which we knew\\nwere common. Birdie gathered rocks from over the hill, nothing was too\\nbig for him; Bill did the banking up outside while I built the wall with\\nthe boulders. The rocks were good, the snow, however, was blown so hard\\nas to be practically ice; a pick made little impression upon it, and the\\nonly way was to chip out big blocks gradually with the small shovel. The\\ngravel was scanty, but good when there was any. Altogether things looked\\nvery hopeful when we turned in to the tent some 150 yards down the slope,\\nhaving done about half one of the long walls.\\"[154]\\nThe view from eight hundred feet up the mountain was magnificent and I\\ngot my spectacles out and cleared the ice away time after time to look.\\nTo the east a great field of pressure ridges below, looking in the\\nmoonlight as if giants had been ploughing with ploughs which made furrows\\nfifty or sixty feet deep: these ran right up to the Barrier edge, and\\nbeyond was the frozen Ross Sea, lying flat, white and peaceful as though\\nsuch things as blizzards were unknown.

Behind us Mount Terror on which we stood, and over all the grey\\nlimitless Barrier seemed to cast a spell of cold immensity, vague,\\nponderous, a breeding-place of wind and drift and darkness. God! What a\\nplace!\\n\\"There was now little moonlight or daylight, but for the next forty-eight\\nhours we used both to their utmost, being up at all times by day and\\nnight, and often working on when there was great difficulty in seeing\\nanything; digging by the light of the hurricane lamp. By the end of two\\ndays we had the walls built, and banked up to one or two feet from the\\ntop; we were to fit the roof cloth close before banking up the rest. The\\ngreat difficulty in banking was the hardness of the snow, it being\\nimpossible to fill in the cracks between the blocks which were more like\\npaving-stones than anything else. The door was in, being a triangular\\ntent doorway, with flaps which we built close in to the walls, cementing\\nit with snow and rocks. The top folded over a plank and the bottom was\\ndug into the ground.\\"[155]\\nBirdie was very disappointed that we could not finish the whole thing\\nthat day: he was nearly angry about it, but there was a lot to do yet and\\nwe were tired out. We turned out early the next morning (Tuesday 18th) to\\ntry and finish the igloo, but it was blowing too hard. When we got to\\nthe top we did some digging but it was quite impossible to get the roof\\non, and we had to leave it.

Turning left handed we headed towards\\nthe sea-ice, knowing that there were some two miles of pressure between\\nus and Cape Crozier itself. For about half a mile it was fair going,\\nrounding big knobs of pressure but always managing to keep more or less\\non the flat and near the ice-cliff which soon rose to a very great height\\non our left. Bill\'s idea was to try and keep close under this cliff,\\nalong that same Discovery way which I have mentioned above. They never\\narrived there early enough for the eggs in those days; the chicks were\\nhatched. Whether we should now find any Emperors, and if so whether they\\nwould have any eggs, was by no means certain.\\nHowever, we soon began to get into trouble, meeting several crevasses\\nevery few yards, and I have no doubt crossing scores of others of which\\nwe had no knowledge. Though we hugged the cliffs as close as possible we\\nfound ourselves on the top of the first pressure ridge, separated by a\\ndeep gulf from the ice-slope which we wished to reach. Then we were in a\\ngreat valley between the first and second ridges: we got into huge heaps\\nof ice pressed up in every shape on every side, crevassed in every\\ndirection: we slithered over snow-slopes and crawled along drift ridges,\\ntrying to get in towards the cliffs. And always we came up against\\nimpossible places and had to crawl back. Bill led on a length of Alpine\\nrope fastened to the toggle of the sledge; Birdie was in his harness also\\nfastened to the toggle, and I was in my harness fastened to the rear of\\nthe sledge, which was of great use to us both as a bridge and a ladder.\\nTwo or three times we tried to get down the ice-slopes to the\\ncomparatively level road under the cliff, but it was always too great a\\ndrop. In that dim light every proportion was distorted; some of the\\nplaces we actually did manage to negotiate with ice-axes and Alpine rope\\nlooked absolute precipices, and there were always crevasses at the bottom\\nif you slipped. On the way back I did slip into one of these and was\\nhauled out by the other two standing on the wall above me.\\nWe then worked our way down into the hollow between the first and second\\nlarge pressure ridges, and I believe on to the top of the second. The\\ncrests here rose fifty or sixty feet. After this I don\'t know where we\\nwent. Our best landmarks were patches of crevasses, sometimes three or\\nfour in a few footsteps. The temperatures were lowish (-37\xb0), it was\\nimpossible for me to wear spectacles, and this was a tremendous\\ndifficulty to me and handicap to the party: Bill would find a crevasse\\nand point it out; Birdie would cross; and then time after time, in trying\\nto step over or climb over on the sledge, I put my feet right into the\\nmiddle of the cracks. This day I went well in at least six times; once,\\nwhen we were close to the sea, rolling into and out of one and then down\\na steep slope until brought up by Birdie and Bill on the rope.\\n[Illustration: A PROCESSION OF EMPERORS]\\n[Illustration: THE KNOLL BEHIND THE CLIFFS OF CAPE CROZIER]\\nWe blundered along until we got into a great cul-de-sac which probably\\nformed the end of the two ridges, where they butted on to the sea-ice. On\\nall sides rose great walls of battered ice with steep snow-slopes in\\nthe middle, where we slithered about and blundered into crevasses. To the\\nleft rose the huge cliff of Cape Crozier, but we could not tell whether\\nthere were not two or three pressure ridges between us and it, and though\\nwe tried at least four ways, there was no possibility of getting forward.\\nAnd then we heard the Emperors calling.\\nTheir cries came to us from the sea-ice we could not see, but which must\\nhave been a chaotic quarter of a mile away. They came echoing back from\\nthe cliffs, as we stood helpless and tantalized. We listened and realized\\nthat there was nothing for it but to return, for the little light which\\nnow came in the middle of the day was going fast, and to be caught in\\nabsolute darkness there was a horrible idea. We started back on our\\ntracks and almost immediately I lost my footing and rolled down a slope\\ninto a crevasse. Birdie and Bill kept their balance and I clambered back\\nto them. The tracks were very faint and we soon began to lose them.\\nBirdie was the best man at following tracks that I have ever known, and\\nhe found them time after time. But at last even he lost them altogether\\nand we settled we must just go ahead. As a matter of fact, we picked them\\nup again, and by then were out of the worst: but we were glad to see the\\ntent.\\nThe next morning (Thursday, June 20) we started work on the igloo at 3\\nA.M. and managed to get the canvas roof on in spite of a wind which\\nharried us all that day. Little did we think what that roof had in store\\nfor us as we packed it in with snow blocks, stretching it over our second\\nsledge, which we put athwartships across the middle of the longer walls.\\nThe windward (south) end came right down to the ground and we tied it\\nsecurely to rocks before packing it in. On the other three sides we had a\\ngood two feet or more of slack all round, and in every case we tied it to\\nrocks by lanyards at intervals of two feet. The door was the difficulty,\\nand for the present we left the cloth arching over the stones, forming a\\nkind of portico. The whole was well packed in and over with slabs of hard\\nsnow, but there was no soft snow with which to fill up the gaps between\\nthe blocks. However, we felt already that nothing could drag that roof\\nout of its packing, and subsequent events proved that we were right.\\nIt was a bleak job for three o\'clock in the morning before breakfast, and\\nwe were glad to get back to the tent and a meal, for we meant to have\\nanother go at the Emperors that day. With the first glimpse of light we\\nwere off for the rookery again.\\nBut we now knew one or two things about that pressure which we had not\\nknown twenty-four hours ago; for instance, that there was a lot of\\nalteration since the Discovery days and that probably the pressure was\\nbigger. As a matter of fact it has been since proved by photographs that\\nthe ridges now ran out three-quarters of a mile farther into the sea than\\nthey did ten years before. We knew also that if we entered the pressure\\nat the only place where the ice-cliffs came down to the level of the\\nBarrier, as we did yesterday, we could neither penetrate to the rookery\\nnor get in under the cliffs where formerly a possible way had been found.\\nThere was only one other thing to do--to go over the cliff. And this was\\nwhat we proposed to try and do.\\nNow these ice-cliffs are some two hundred feet high, and I felt\\nuncomfortable, especially in the dark. But as we came back the day before\\nwe had noticed at one place a break in the cliffs from which there hung a\\nsnow-drift. It _might_ be possible to get down that drift.\\nAnd so, all harnessed to the sledge, with Bill on a long lead out in\\nfront and Birdie and myself checking the sledge behind, we started down\\nthe slope which ended in the cliff, which of course we could not see. We\\ncrossed a number of small crevasses, and soon we knew we must be nearly\\nthere. Twice we crept up to the edge of the cliff with no success, and\\nthen we found the slope: more, we got down it without great difficulty\\nand it brought us out just where we wanted to be, between the land cliffs\\nand the pressure.\\n[Illustration: THE BARRIER PRESSURE AT CAPE CROZIER]\\nThen began the most exciting climb among the pressure that you can\\nimagine. At first very much as it was the day before--pulling\\nourselves and one another up ridges, slithering down slopes, tumbling\\ninto and out of crevasses and holes of all sorts, we made our way along\\nunder the cliffs which rose higher and higher above us as we neared the\\nblack lava precipices which form Cape Crozier itself. We straddled along\\nthe top of a snow ridge with a razor-backed edge, balancing the sledge\\nbetween us as we wriggled: on our right was a drop of great depth with\\ncrevasses at the bottom, on our left was a smaller drop also crevassed.\\nWe crawled along, and I can tell you it was exciting work in the more\\nthan half darkness. At the end was a series of slopes full of crevasses,\\nand finally we got right in under the rock on to moraine, and here we had\\nto leave the sledge.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.10","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The explorers cross over difficult terrain to arrive at the Emperor penguins, from whom they collect eggs and skins.

The tumult of\\npressure which climbed against them showed no order here. Four hundred\\nmiles of moving ice behind it had just tossed and twisted those giant\\nridges until Job himself would have lacked words to reproach their Maker.\\nWe scrambled over and under, hanging on with our axes, and cutting steps\\nwhere we could not find a foothold with our crampons. And always we got\\ntowards the Emperor penguins, and it really began to look as if we were\\ngoing to do it this time, when we came up against a wall of ice which a\\nsingle glance told us we could never cross. One of the largest pressure\\nridges had been thrown, end on, against the cliff. We seemed to be\\nstopped, when Bill found a black hole, something like a fox\'s earth,\\ndisappearing into the bowels of the ice. We looked at it: \\"Well, here\\ngoes!\\" he said, and put his head in, and disappeared. Bowers likewise. It\\nwas a longish way, but quite possible to wriggle along, and presently I\\nfound myself looking out of the other side with a deep gully below me,\\nthe rock face on one hand and the ice on the other. \\"Put your back\\nagainst the ice and your feet against the rock and lever yourself along,\\"\\nsaid Bill, who was already standing on firm ice at the far end in a snow\\npit. We cut some fifteen steps to get out of that hole. Excited by now,\\nand thoroughly enjoying ourselves, we found the way ahead easier, until\\nthe penguins\' call reached us again and we stood, three crystallized\\nragamuffins, above the Emperors\' home. They were there all right, and we\\nwere going to reach them, but where were all the thousands of which we\\nhad heard?\\nWe stood on an ice-foot which was really a dwarf cliff some twelve feet\\nhigh, and the sea-ice, with a good many ice-blocks strewn upon it, lay\\nbelow. The cliff dropped straight, with a bit of an overhang and no\\nsnow-drift. This may have been because the sea had only frozen recently;\\nwhatever the reason may have been it meant that we should have a lot of\\ndifficulty in getting up again without help. It was decided that some one\\nmust stop on the top with the Alpine rope, and clearly that one should be\\nI, for with short sight and fogged spectacles which I could not wear I\\nwas much the least useful of the party for the job immediately ahead. Had\\nwe had the sledge we could have used it as a ladder, but of course we had\\nleft this at the beginning of the moraine miles back.\\nWe saw the Emperors standing all together huddled under the Barrier cliff\\nsome hundreds of yards away. The little light was going fast: we were\\nmuch more excited about the approach of complete darkness and the look of\\nwind in the south than we were about our triumph. After indescribable\\neffort and hardship we were witnessing a marvel of the natural world, and\\nwe were the first and only men who had ever done so; we had within our\\ngrasp material which might prove of the utmost importance to science; we\\nwere turning theories into facts with every observation we made,--and we\\nhad but a moment to give.\\n[Illustration: EMPERORS, BARRIER AND SEA ICE--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nThe disturbed Emperors made a tremendous row, trumpeting with their\\ncurious metallic voices. There was no doubt they had eggs, for they tried\\nto shuffle along the ground without losing them off their feet. But when\\nthey were hustled a good many eggs were dropped and left lying on the\\nice, and some of these were quickly picked up by eggless Emperors who had\\nprobably been waiting a long time for the opportunity. In these poor\\nbirds the maternal side seems to have necessarily swamped the other\\nfunctions of life. Such is the struggle for existence that they can only\\nlive by a glut of maternity, and it would be interesting to know whether\\nsuch a life leads to happiness or satisfaction.\\nI have told[156] how the men of the Discovery found this rookery where we\\nnow stood. How they made journeys in the early spring but never arrived\\nearly enough to get eggs and only found parents and chicks. They\\nconcluded that the Emperor was an impossible kind of bird who, for some\\nreason or other, nests in the middle of the Antarctic winter with the\\ntemperature anywhere below seventy degrees of frost, and the blizzards\\nblowing, always blowing, against his devoted back. And they found him\\nholding his precious chick balanced upon his big feet, and pressing it\\nmaternally, or paternally (for both sexes squabble for the privilege)\\nagainst a bald patch in his breast. And when at last he simply must go\\nand eat something in the open leads near by, he just puts the child down\\non the ice, and twenty chickless Emperors rush to pick it up. And they\\nfight over it, and so tear it that sometimes it will die. And, if it can,\\nit will crawl into any ice-crack to escape from so much kindness, and\\nthere it will freeze. Likewise many broken and addled eggs were found,\\nand it is clear that the mortality is very great. But some survive, and\\nsummer comes; and when a big blizzard is going to blow (they know all\\nabout the weather), the parents take the children out for miles across\\nthe sea-ice, until they reach the threshold of the open sea. And there\\nthey sit until the wind comes, and the swell rises, and breaks that\\nice-floe off; and away they go in the blinding drift to join the main\\npack-ice, with a private yacht all to themselves.\\nYou must agree that a bird like this is an interesting beast, and when,\\nseven months ago, we rowed a boat under those great black cliffs,[157]\\nand found a disconsolate Emperor chick still in the down, we knew\\ndefinitely why the Emperor has to nest in mid-winter. For if a June egg\\nwas still without feathers in the beginning of January, the same egg\\nlaid in the summer would leave its produce without practical covering for\\nthe following winter. Thus the Emperor penguin is compelled to undertake\\nall kinds of hardships because his children insist on developing so\\nslowly, very much as we are tied in our human relationships for the same\\nreason. It is of interest that such a primitive bird should have so long\\na childhood.\\nBut interesting as the life history of these birds must be, we had not\\ntravelled for three weeks to see them sitting on their eggs. We wanted\\nthe embryos, and we wanted them as young as possible, and fresh and\\nunfrozen that specialists at home might cut them into microscopic\\nsections and learn from them the previous history of birds throughout the\\nevolutionary ages. And so Bill and Birdie rapidly collected five eggs,\\nwhich we hoped to carry safely in our fur mitts to our igloo upon Mount\\nTerror, where we could pickle them in the alcohol we had brought for the\\npurpose. We also wanted oil for our blubber stove, and they killed and\\nskinned three birds--an Emperor weighs up to 6\xbd stones.\\nThe Ross Sea was frozen over, and there were no seal in sight. There were\\nonly 100 Emperors as compared with 2000 in 1902 and 1903. Bill reckoned\\nthat every fourth or fifth bird had an egg, but this was only a rough\\nestimate, for we did not want to disturb them unnecessarily. It is a\\nmystery why there should have been so few birds, but it certainly looked\\nas though the ice had not formed very long. Were these the first\\narrivals? Had a previous rookery been blown out to sea and was this the\\nbeginning of a second attempt? Is this bay of sea-ice becoming unsafe?\\nThose who previously discovered the Emperors with their chicks saw the\\npenguins nursing dead and frozen chicks if they were unable to obtain a\\nlive one. They also found decomposed eggs which they must have incubated\\nafter they had been frozen. Now we found that these birds were so anxious\\nto sit on something that some of those which had no eggs were sitting on\\nice! Several times Bill and Birdie picked up eggs to find them lumps of\\nice, rounded and about the right size, dirty and hard. Once a bird\\ndropped an ice nest egg as they watched, and again a bird returned and\\ntucked another into itself, immediately forsaking it for a real one,\\nhowever, when one was offered.\\nMeanwhile a whole procession of Emperors came round under the cliff on\\nwhich I stood. The light was already very bad and it was well that my\\ncompanions were quick in returning: we had to do everything in a great\\nhurry. I hauled up the eggs in their mitts (which we fastened together\\nround our necks with lampwick lanyards) and then the skins, but failed to\\nhelp Bill at all. \\"Pull,\\" he cried, from the bottom: \\"I am pulling,\\" I\\nsaid. \\"But the line\'s quite slack down here,\\" he shouted. And when he had\\nreached the top by climbing up on Bowers\' shoulders, and we were both\\npulling all we knew Birdie\'s end of the rope was still slack in his\\nhands. Directly we put on a strain the rope cut into the ice edge and\\njammed--a very common difficulty when working among crevasses. We tried\\nto run the rope over an ice-axe without success, and things began to look\\nserious when Birdie, who had been running about prospecting and had\\nmeanwhile put one leg through a crack into the sea, found a place where\\nthe cliff did not overhang. He cut steps for himself, we hauled, and at\\nlast we were all together on the top--his foot being by now surrounded by\\na solid mass of ice.\\nWe legged it back as hard as we could go: five eggs in our fur mitts,\\nBirdie with two skins tied to him and trailing behind, and myself with\\none. We were roped up, and climbing the ridges and getting through the\\nholes was very difficult. In one place where there was a steep rubble and\\nsnow slope down I left the ice-axe half way up; in another it was too\\ndark to see our former ice-axe footsteps, and I could see nothing, and so\\njust let myself go and trusted to luck. With infinite patience Bill said:\\n\\"Cherry, you _must_ learn how to use an ice-axe.\\" For the rest of the\\ntrip my wind-clothes were in rags.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.11","output":"Summary: The passage describes the difficulties faced by the author and his team in building their igloo, dealing with harsh weather conditions, and preparing for their return journey.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"Most men would have howled...self-control.\\"\\nExcerpt 2: \\"The wear and tear on our minds was very great...unendurable.\\"\\n\\nText_to_image: An igloo on a mountain slope with a tent pitched outside, surrounded by blowing snow and ice, with two men inside their sleeping bags, one awake and looking out at the raging storm outside.","parsed":{"summary":"Summary: The passage describes the difficulties faced by the author and his team in building their igloo, dealing with harsh weather conditions, and preparing for their return journey.","excerpt_1":"\\"Most men would have howled...self-control.\\"","excerpt_2":"\\"The wear and tear on our minds was very great...unendurable.\\"","text_to_image":"An igloo on a mountain slope with a tent pitched outside, surrounded by blowing snow and ice, with two men inside their sleeping bags, one awake and looking out at the raging storm outside."},"passage":"We found the sledge, and none too soon, and now had three eggs left,\\nmore or less whole.

When we got into the hollows under the ridge where we had to\\ncross, it was too dark to do anything but feel our way. We did so over\\nmany crevasses, found the ridge and crept over it. Higher up we could see\\nmore, but to follow our tracks soon became impossible, and we plugged\\nstraight ahead and luckily found the slope down which we had come. All\\nday it had been blowing a nasty cold wind with a temperature between -20\xb0\\nand 30\xb0, which we felt a good deal. Now it began to get worse. The\\nweather was getting thick and things did not look very nice when we\\nstarted up to find our tent. Soon it was blowing force 4, and soon we\\nmissed our way entirely. We got right up above the patch of rocks which\\nmarked our igloo and only found it after a good deal of search.\\nI have heard tell of an English officer at the Dardanelles who was left,\\nblinded, in No Man\'s Land between the English and Turkish trenches.\\nMoving only at night, and having no sense to tell him which were his own\\ntrenches, he was fired at by Turk and English alike as he groped his\\nghastly way to and from them. Thus he spent days and nights until, one\\nnight, he crawled towards the English trenches, to be fired at as usual.\\n\\"Oh God! what can I do!\\" some one heard him say, and he was brought in.\\nSuch extremity of suffering cannot be measured: madness or death may give\\nrelief. But this I know: we on this journey were already beginning to\\nthink of death as a friend. As we groped our way back that night,\\nsleepless, icy, and dog-tired in the dark and the wind and the drift, a\\ncrevasse seemed almost a friendly gift.\\n\\"Things must improve,\\" said Bill next day, \\"I think we reached bed-rock\\nlast night.\\" We hadn\'t, by a long way.\\nIt was like this.\\nWe moved into the igloo for the first time, for we had to save oil by\\nusing our blubber stove if we were to have any left to travel home with,\\nand we did not wish to cover our tent with the oily black filth which the\\nuse of blubber necessitates. The blizzard blew all night, and we were\\ncovered with drift which came in through hundreds of leaks: in this\\nwind-swept place we had found no soft snow with which we could pack our\\nhard snow blocks. As we flensed some blubber from one of our penguin\\nskins the powdery drift covered everything we had.\\nThough uncomfortable this was nothing to worry about overmuch. Some of\\nthe drift which the blizzard was bringing would collect to leeward of our\\nhut and the rocks below which it was built, and they could be used to\\nmake our hut more weather-proof. Then with great difficulty we got the\\nblubber stove to start, and it spouted a blob of boiling oil into Bill\'s\\neye. For the rest of the night he lay, quite unable to stifle his groans,\\nobviously in very great pain: he told us afterwards that he thought his\\neye was gone. We managed to cook a meal somehow, and Birdie got the stove\\ngoing afterwards, but it was quite useless to try and warm the place. I\\ngot out and cut the green canvas outside the door, so as to get the roof\\ncloth in under the stones, and then packed it down as well as I could\\nwith snow, and so blocked most of the drift coming in.\\nIt is extraordinary how often angels and fools do the same thing in this\\nlife, and I have never been able to settle which we were on this journey.\\nI never heard an angry word: once only (when this same day I could not\\npull Bill up the cliff out of the penguin rookery) I heard an impatient\\none: and these groans were the nearest approach to complaint. Most men\\nwould have howled. \\"I think we reached bed-rock last night,\\" was strong\\nlanguage for Bill. \\"I was incapacitated for a short time,\\" he says in his\\nreport to Scott.[158] Endurance was tested on this journey under unique\\ncircumstances, and always these two men with all the burden of\\nresponsibility which did not fall upon myself, displayed that quality\\nwhich is perhaps the only one which may be said with certainty to make\\nfor success, self-control.\\nWe spent the next day--it was July 21--in collecting every scrap of soft\\nsnow we could find and packing it into the crevasses between our hard\\nsnow blocks. It was a pitifully small amount but we could see no cracks\\nwhen we had finished. To counteract the lifting tendency the wind had on\\nour roof we cut some great flat hard snow blocks and laid them on the\\ncanvas top to steady it against the sledge which formed the ridge\\nsupport. We also pitched our tent outside the igloo door. Both tent and\\nigloo were therefore eight or nine hundred feet up Terror: both were\\nbelow an outcrop of rocks from which the mountain fell steeply to the\\nBarrier behind us, and from this direction came the blizzards. In front\\nof us the slope fell for a mile or more down to the ice-cliffs, so\\nwind-swept that we had to wear crampons to walk upon it. Most of the tent\\nwas in the lee of the igloo, but the cap of it came over the igloo roof,\\nwhile a segment of the tent itself jutted out beyond the igloo wall.\\nThat night we took much of our gear into the tent and lighted the blubber\\nstove. I always mistrusted that stove, and every moment I expected it to\\nflare up and burn the tent. But the heat it gave, as it burned furiously,\\nwith the double lining of the tent to contain it, was considerable.\\nIt did not matter, except for a routine which we never managed to keep,\\nwhether we started to thaw our way into our frozen sleeping-bags at 4 in\\nthe morning or 4 in the afternoon. I think we must have turned in during\\nthe afternoon of that Friday, leaving the cooker, our finnesko, a deal of\\nour foot-gear, Bowers\' bag of personal gear, and many other things in the\\ntent. I expect we left the blubber stove there too, for it was quite\\nuseless at present to try and warm the igloo. The tent floor-cloth was\\nunder our sleeping-bags in the igloo.\\n\\"Things must improve,\\" said Bill. After all there was much for which to\\nbe thankful. I don\'t think anybody could have made a better igloo with\\nthe hard snow blocks and rocks which were all we had: we would get it\\nair-tight by degrees. The blubber stove was working, and we had fuel for\\nit: we had also found a way down to the penguins and had three complete,\\nthough frozen eggs: the two which had been in my mitts smashed when I\\nfell about because I could not wear spectacles. Also the twilight given\\nby the sun below the horizon at noon was getting longer.\\nBut already we had been out twice as long in winter as the longest\\nprevious journeys in spring. The men who made those journeys had daylight\\nwhere we had darkness, they had never had such low temperatures,\\ngenerally nothing approaching them, and they had seldom worked in such\\ndifficult country. The nearest approach to healthy sleep we had had for\\nnearly a month was when during blizzards the temperature allowed the\\nwarmth of our bodies to thaw some of the ice in our clothing and\\nsleeping-bags into water. The wear and tear on our minds was very great.\\nWe were certainly weaker. We had a little more than a tin of oil to get\\nback on, and we knew the conditions we had to face on that journey across\\nthe Barrier: even with fresh men and fresh gear it had been almost\\nunendurable.\\nAnd so we spent half an hour or more getting into our bags. Cirrus cloud\\nwas moving across the face of the stars from the north, it looked rather\\nhazy and thick to the south, but it is always difficult to judge weather\\nin the dark. There was little wind and the temperature was in the minus\\ntwenties. We felt no particular uneasiness. Our tent was well dug in, and\\nwas also held down by rocks and the heavy tank off the sledge which were\\nplaced on the skirting as additional security. We felt that no power on\\nearth could move the thick walls of our igloo, nor drag the canvas roof\\nfrom the middle of the embankment into which it was packed and lashed.\\n\\"Things must improve,\\" said Bill.\\nI do not know what time it was when I woke up. It was calm, with that\\nabsolute silence which can be so soothing or so terrible as circumstances\\ndictate. Then there came a sob of wind, and all was still again. Ten\\nminutes and it was blowing as though the world was having a fit of\\nhysterics. The earth was torn in pieces: the indescribable fury and roar\\nof it all cannot be imagined.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.12","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The explorers struggle to rescue gear and protect their igloo and tent from a raging blizzard in Antarctica, during which they lose their tent and the roof of their igloo.

It is always these early\\nmorning shocks which hit one hardest: our slow minds suggested that this\\nmight mean a peculiarly lingering form of death. Journey after journey\\nBirdie and I fought our way across the few yards which had separated the\\ntent from the igloo door. I have never understood why so much of our gear\\nwhich was in the tent remained, even in the lee of the igloo. The place\\nwhere the tent had been was littered with gear, and when we came to\\nreckon up afterwards we had everything except the bottom piece of the\\ncooker, and the top of the outer cooker. We never saw these again. The\\nmost wonderful thing of all was that our finnesko were lying where they\\nwere left, which happened to be on the ground in the part of the tent\\nwhich was under the lee of the igloo. Also Birdie\'s bag of personal gear\\nwas there, and a tin of sweets.\\nBirdie brought two tins of sweets away with him. One we had to celebrate\\nour arrival at the Knoll: this was the second, of which we knew nothing,\\nand which was for Bill\'s birthday, the next day. We started eating them\\non Saturday, however, and the tin came in useful to Bill afterwards.\\nTo get that gear in we fought against solid walls of black snow which\\nflowed past us and tried to hurl us down the slope. Once started nothing\\ncould have stopped us. I saw Birdie knocked over once, but he clawed his\\nway back just in time. Having passed everything we could find in to Bill,\\nwe got back into the igloo, and started to collect things together,\\nincluding our very dishevelled minds.\\nThere was no doubt that we were in the devil of a mess, and it was not\\naltogether our fault. We had had to put our igloo more or less where we\\ncould get rocks with which to build it. Very naturally we had given both\\nour tent and igloo all the shelter we could from the full force of the\\nwind, and now it seemed we were in danger not because they were in the\\nwind, but because they were not sufficiently in it. The main force of the\\nhurricane, deflected by the ridge behind, fled over our heads and\\nappeared to form by suction a vacuum below. Our tent had either been\\nsucked upwards into this, or had been blown away because some of it was\\nin the wind while some of it was not. The roof of our igloo was being\\nwrenched upwards and then dropped back with great crashes: the drift was\\nspouting in, not it seemed because it was blown in from outside, but\\nbecause it was sucked in from within: the lee, not the weather, wall was\\nthe worst. Already everything was six or eight inches under snow.\\nVery soon we began to be alarmed about the igloo. For some time the heavy\\nsnow blocks we had heaved up on to the canvas roof kept it weighted down.\\nBut it seemed that they were being gradually moved off by the hurricane.\\nThe tension became well-nigh unendurable: the waiting in all that welter\\nof noise was maddening. Minute after minute, hour after hour--those snow\\nblocks were off now anyway, and the roof was smashed up and down--no\\ncanvas ever made could stand it indefinitely.\\nWe got a meal that Saturday morning, our last for a very long time as it\\nhappened. Oil being of such importance to us we tried to use the blubber\\nstove, but after several preliminary spasms it came to pieces in our\\nhands, some solder having melted; and a very good thing too, I thought,\\nfor it was more dangerous than useful. We finished cooking our meal on\\nthe primus. Two bits of the cooker having been blown away we had to\\nbalance it on the primus as best we could. We then settled that in view\\nof the shortage of oil we would not have another meal for as long as\\npossible. As a matter of fact God settled that for us.\\nWe did all we could to stop up the places where the drift was coming in,\\nplugging the holes with our socks, mitts and other clothing. But it was\\nno real good. Our igloo was a vacuum which was filling itself up as soon\\nas possible: and when snow was not coming in a fine black moraine dust\\ntook its place, covering us and everything. For twenty-four hours we\\nwaited for the roof to go: things were so bad now that we dare not unlash\\nthe door.\\nMany hours ago Bill had told us that if the roof went he considered that\\nour best chance would be to roll over in our sleeping-bags until we were\\nlying on the openings, and get frozen and drifted in.\\nGradually the situation got more desperate. The distance between the\\ntaut-sucked canvas and the sledge on which it should have been resting\\nbecame greater, and this must have been due to the stretching of the\\ncanvas itself and the loss of the snow blocks on the top: it was not\\ndrawing out of the walls. The crashes as it dropped and banged out again\\nwere louder. There was more snow coming through the walls, though all our\\nloose mitts, socks and smaller clothing were stuffed into the worst\\nplaces: our pyjama jackets were stuffed between the roof and the rocks\\nover the door. The rocks were lifting and shaking here till we thought\\nthey would fall.\\nWe talked by shouting, and long before this one of us proposed to try and\\nget the Alpine rope lashed down over the roof from outside. But Bowers\\nsaid it was an absolute impossibility in that wind. \\"You could never ask\\nmen at sea to try such a thing,\\" he said. He was up and out of his bag\\ncontinually, stopping up holes, pressing against bits of roof to try and\\nprevent the flapping and so forth. He was magnificent.\\nAnd then it went.\\nBirdie was over by the door, where the canvas which was bent over the\\nlintel board was working worse than anywhere else. Bill was practically\\nout of his bag pressing against some part with a long stick of some kind.\\nI don\'t know what I was doing but I was half out of and half in my bag.\\nThe top of the door opened in little slits and that green Willesden\\ncanvas flapped into hundreds of little fragments in fewer seconds than it\\ntakes to read this. The uproar of it all was indescribable. Even above\\nthe savage thunder of that great wind on the mountain came the lash of\\nthe canvas as it was whipped to little tiny strips. The highest rocks\\nwhich we had built into our walls fell upon us, and a sheet of drift came\\nin.\\nBirdie dived for his sleeping-bag and eventually got in, together with a\\nterrible lot of drift. Bill also--but he was better off: I was already\\nhalf into mine and all right, so I turned to help Bill. \\"Get into your\\nown,\\" he shouted, and when I continued to try and help him, he leaned\\nover until his mouth was against my ear. \\"_Please_, Cherry,\\" he said, and\\nhis voice was terribly anxious. I know he felt responsible: feared it was\\nhe who had brought us to this ghastly end.\\nThe next I knew was Bowers\' head across Bill\'s body. \\"We\'re all right,\\"\\nhe yelled, and we answered in the affirmative. Despite the fact that we\\nknew we only said so because we knew we were all wrong, this statement\\nwas helpful. Then we turned our bags over as far as possible, so that the\\nbottom of the bag was uppermost and the flaps were more or less beneath\\nus. And we lay and thought, and sometimes we sang.\\nI suppose, wrote Wilson, we were all revolving plans to get back without\\na tent: and the one thing we had left was the floor-cloth upon which we\\nwere actually lying. Of course we could not speak at present, but later\\nafter the blizzard had stopped we discussed the possibility of digging a\\nhole in the snow each night and covering it over with the floor-cloth. I\\ndo not think we had any idea that we could really get back in those\\ntemperatures in our present state of ice by such means, but no one ever\\nhinted at such a thing. Birdie and Bill sang quite a lot of songs and\\nhymns, snatches of which reached me every now and then, and I chimed in,\\nsomewhat feebly I suspect. Of course we were getting pretty badly drifted\\nup. \\"I was resolved to keep warm,\\" wrote Bowers, \\"and beneath my debris\\ncovering I paddled my feet and sang all the songs and hymns I knew to\\npass the time. I could occasionally thump Bill, and as he still moved I\\nknew he was alive all right--what a birthday for him!\\" Birdie was more\\ndrifted up than we, but at times we all had to hummock ourselves up to\\nheave the snow off our bags. By opening the flaps of our bags we could\\nget small pinches of soft drift which we pressed together and put into\\nour mouths to melt. When our hands warmed up again we got some more; so\\nwe did not get very thirsty. A few ribbons of canvas still remained in\\nthe wall over our heads, and these produced volleys of cracks like pistol\\nshots hour after hour. The canvas never drew out from the walls, not an\\ninch. The wind made just the same noise as an express train running fast\\nthrough a tunnel if you have both the windows down.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.13","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The explorers\' tent is destroyed during a blizzard, leaving them stranded in the freezing cold with limited supplies.

They must have been frightened but they were never disturbed. As\\nfor me I never had any hope at all; and when the roof went I felt that\\nthis was the end. What else could I think? We had spent days in reaching\\nthis place through the darkness in cold such as had never been\\nexperienced by human beings. We had been out for four weeks under\\nconditions in which no man had existed previously for more than a few\\ndays, if that. During this time we had seldom slept except from sheer\\nphysical exhaustion, as men sleep on the rack; and every minute of it we\\nhad been fighting for the bed-rock necessaries of bare existence, and\\nalways in the dark. We had kept ourselves going by enormous care of our\\nfeet and hands and bodies, by burning oil, and by having plenty of hot\\nfatty food. Now we had no tent, one tin of oil left out of six, and only\\npart of our cooker. When we were lucky and not too cold we could almost\\nwring water from our clothes, and directly we got out of our\\nsleeping-bags we were frozen into solid sheets of armoured ice. In cold\\ntemperatures with all the advantages of a tent over our heads we were\\nalready taking more than an hour of fierce struggling and cramp to get\\ninto our sleeping-bags--so frozen were they and so long did it take us to\\nthaw our way in. No! Without the tent we were dead men.\\n[Illustration: MT. EREBUS]\\n[Illustration: ICE PRESSURE AT A]\\nAnd there seemed not one chance in a million that we should ever see our\\ntent again. We were 900 feet up on the mountain side, and the wind blew\\nabout as hard as a wind can blow straight out to sea. First there was a\\nsteep slope, so hard that a pick made little impression upon it, so\\nslippery that if you started down in finnesko you never could stop: this\\nended in a great ice-cliff some hundreds of feet high, and then came\\nmiles of pressure ridges, crevassed and tumbled, in which you might as\\nwell look for a daisy as a tent: and after that the open sea. The\\nchances, however, were that the tent had just been taken up into the air\\nand dropped somewhere in this sea well on the way to New Zealand.\\nObviously the tent was gone.\\nFace to face with real death one does not think of the things that\\ntorment the bad people in the tracts, and fill the good people with\\nbliss. I might have speculated on my chances of going to Heaven; but\\ncandidly I did not care. I could not have wept if I had tried. I had no\\nwish to review the evils of my past. But the past did seem to have been a\\nbit wasted. The road to Hell may be paved with good intentions: the road\\nto Heaven is paved with lost opportunities.\\nI wanted those years over again. What fun I would have with them: what\\nglorious fun! It was a pity. Well has the Persian said that when we come\\nto die we, remembering that God is merciful, will gnaw our elbows with\\nremorse for thinking of the things we have not done for fear of the Day\\nof Judgment.\\nAnd I wanted peaches and syrup--badly. We had them at the hut, sweeter\\nand more luscious than you can imagine. And we had been without sugar for\\na month. Yes--especially the syrup.\\nThus impiously I set out to die, making up my mind that I was not going\\nto try and keep warm, that it might not take too long, and thinking I\\nwould try and get some morphia from the medical case if it got very bad.\\nNot a bit heroic, and entirely true! Yes! comfortable, warm reader. Men\\ndo not fear death, they fear the pain of dying.\\nAnd then quite naturally and no doubt disappointingly to those who would\\nlike to read of my last agonies (for who would not give pleasure by his\\ndeath?) I fell asleep. I expect the temperature was pretty high during\\nthis great blizzard, and anything near zero was very high to us. That\\nand the snow which drifted over us made a pleasant wet kind of snipe\\nmarsh inside our sleeping-bags, and I am sure we all dozed a good bit.\\nThere was so much to worry about that there was not the least use in\\nworrying; and we were so _very_ tired. We were hungry, for the last meal\\nwe had had was in the morning of the day before, but hunger was not very\\npressing.\\nAnd so we lay, wet and quite fairly warm, hour after hour while the wind\\nroared round us, blowing storm force continually and rising in the gusts\\nto something indescribable. Storm force is force 11, and force 12 is the\\nbiggest wind which can be logged: Bowers logged it force 11, but he was\\nalways so afraid of overestimating that he was inclined to underrate. I\\nthink it was blowing a full hurricane. Sometimes awake, sometimes dozing,\\nwe had not a very uncomfortable time so far as I can remember. I knew\\nthat parties which had come to Cape Crozier in the spring had experienced\\nblizzards which lasted eight or ten days. But this did not worry us as\\nmuch as I think it did Bill: I was numb. I vaguely called to mind that\\nPeary had survived a blizzard in the open: but wasn\'t that in the summer?\\nIt was in the early morning of Saturday (July 22) that we discovered the\\nloss of the tent. Some time during that morning we had had our last meal.\\nThe roof went about noon on Sunday and we had had no meal in the interval\\nbecause our supply of oil was so low; nor could we move out of our bags\\nexcept as a last necessity. By Sunday night we had been without a meal\\nfor some thirty-six hours.\\nThe rocks which fell upon us when the roof went did no damage, and though\\nwe could not get out of our bags to move them, we could fit ourselves\\ninto them without difficulty. More serious was the drift which began to\\npile up all round and over us. It helped to keep us warm of course, but\\nat the same time in these comparatively high temperatures it saturated\\nour bags even worse than they were before. If we did not find the tent\\n(and its recovery would be a miracle) these bags and the floor-cloth of\\nthe tent on which we were lying were all we had in that fight back\\nacross the Barrier which could, I suppose, have only had one end.\\nMeanwhile we had to wait. It was nearly 70 miles home and it had taken us\\nthe best part of three weeks to come. In our less miserable moments we\\ntried to think out ways of getting back, but I do not remember very much\\nabout that time. Sunday morning faded into Sunday afternoon,--into Sunday\\nnight,--into Monday morning. Till then the blizzard had raged with\\nmonstrous fury; the winds of the world were there, and they had all gone\\nmad. We had bad winds at Cape Evans this year, and we had far worse the\\nnext winter when the open water was at our doors. But I have never heard\\nor felt or seen a wind like this. I wondered why it did not carry away\\nthe earth.\\nIn the early hours of Monday there was an occasional hint of a lull.\\nOrdinarily in a big winter blizzard, when you have lived for several days\\nand nights with that turmoil in your ears, the lulls are more trying than\\nthe noise: \\"the feel of not to feel it.\\"[159] I do not remember noticing\\nthat now. Seven or eight more hours passed, and though it was still\\nblowing we could make ourselves heard to one another without great\\ndifficulty. It was two days and two nights since we had had a meal.\\nWe decided to get out of our bags and make a search for the tent. We did\\nso, bitterly cold and utterly miserable, though I do not think any of us\\nshowed it. In the darkness we could see very little, and no trace\\nwhatever of the tent. We returned against the wind, nursing our faces and\\nhands, and settled that we must try and cook a meal somehow. We managed\\nabout the weirdest meal eaten north or south. We got the floor-cloth\\nwedged under our bags, then got into our bags and drew the floor-cloth\\nover our heads. Between us we got the primus alight somehow, and by hand\\nwe balanced the cooker on top of it, minus the two members which had been\\nblown away. The flame flickered in the draughts. Very slowly the snow in\\nthe cooker melted, we threw in a plentiful supply of pemmican, and the\\nsmell of it was better than anything on earth. In time we got both tea\\nand pemmican, which was full of hairs from our bags, penguin feathers,\\ndirt and debris, but delicious. The blubber left in the cooker got burnt\\nand gave the tea a burnt taste. None of us ever forgot that meal: I\\nenjoyed it as much as such a meal could be enjoyed, and that burnt taste\\nwill always bring back the memory.\\nIt was still dark and we lay down in our bags again, but soon a little\\nglow of light began to come up, and we turned out to have a further\\nsearch for the tent. Birdie went off before Bill and me. Clumsily I\\ndragged my eider-down out of my bag on my feet, all sopping wet: it was\\nimpossible to get it back and I let it freeze: it was soon just like a\\nrock. The sky to the south was as black and sinister as it could possibly\\nbe. It looked as though the blizzard would be on us again at any moment.\\nI followed Bill down the slope. We could find nothing. But, as we\\nsearched, we heard a shout somewhere below and to the right. We got on a\\nslope, slipped, and went sliding down quite unable to stop ourselves, and\\ncame upon Birdie with the tent, the outer lining still on the bamboos.\\nOur lives had been taken away and given back to us.\\nWe were so thankful we said nothing.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.14","output":"{\\"summary\\": \\"The team finds their tent intact after a blizzard but must now face the prospect of returning home as they are too weak for another expedition.

The\\nbamboos, with the inner lining lashed to them, had entangled the outer\\ncover, and the whole went up together like a shut umbrella. This was our\\nsalvation. If it had opened in the air nothing could have prevented its\\ndestruction. As it was, with all the accumulated ice upon it, it must\\nhave weighed the best part of 100 lbs. It had been dropped about half a\\nmile away, at the bottom of a steep slope: and it fell in a hollow, still\\nshut up. The main force of the wind had passed over it, and there it was,\\nwith the bamboos and fastenings wrenched and strained, and the ends of\\ntwo of the poles broken, but the silk untorn.\\nIf that tent went again we were going with it. We made our way back up\\nthe slope with it, carrying it solemnly and reverently, precious as\\nthough it were something not quite of the earth. And we dug it in as\\ntent was never dug in before; not by the igloo, but in the old place\\nfarther down where we had first arrived. And while Bill was doing this\\nBirdie and I went back to the igloo and dug and scratched and shook away\\nthe drift inside until we had found nearly all our gear. It is wonderful\\nhow little we lost when the roof went. Most of our gear was hung on the\\nsledge, which was part of the roof, or was packed into the holes of the\\nhut to try and make it drift-proof, and the things must have been blown\\ninwards into the bottom of the hut by the wind from the south and the\\nback draught from the north. Then they were all drifted up. Of course a\\ncertain number of mitts and socks were blown away and lost, but the only\\nimportant things were Bill\'s fur mitts, which were stuffed into a hole in\\nthe rocks of the hut. We loaded up the sledge and pushed it down the\\nslope. I don\'t know how Birdie was feeling, but I felt so weak that it\\nwas the greatest labour. The blizzard looked right on top of us.\\nWe had another meal, and we wanted it: and as the good hoosh ran down\\ninto our feet and hands, and up into our cheeks and ears and brains, we\\ndiscussed what we would do next. Birdie was all for another go at the\\nEmperor penguins. Dear Birdie, he never would admit that he was beaten--I\\ndon\'t know that he ever really was! \\"I think he (Wilson) thought he had\\nlanded us in a bad corner and was determined to go straight home, though\\nI was for one other tap at the Rookery. However, I had placed myself\\nunder his orders for this trip voluntarily, and so we started the next\\nday for home.\\"[160] There could really be no common-sense doubt: we had\\nto go back, and we were already very doubtful whether we should ever\\nmanage to get into our sleeping-bags in very low temperature, so ghastly\\nhad they become.\\nI don\'t know when it was, but I remember walking down that slope--I don\'t\\nknow why, perhaps to try and find the bottom of the cooker--and thinking\\nthat there was nothing on earth that a man under such circumstances\\nwould not give for a good warm sleep. He would give everything he\\npossessed: he would give--how many--years of his life. One or two at any\\nrate--perhaps five? Yes--I would give five. I remember the sastrugi, the\\nview of the Knoll, the dim hazy black smudge of the sea far away below:\\nthe tiny bits of green canvas that twittered in the wind on the surface\\nof the snow: the cold misery of it all, and the weakness which was biting\\ninto my heart.\\nFor days Birdie had been urging me to use his eider-down lining--his\\nbeautiful dry bag of the finest down--which he had never slipped into his\\nown fur bag. I had refused: I felt that I should be a beast to take it.\\nWe packed the tank ready for a start back in the morning and turned in,\\nutterly worn out. It was only -12\xb0 that night, but my left big toe was\\nfrost-bitten in my bag which I was trying to use without an eider-down\\nlining, and my bag was always too big for me. It must have taken several\\nhours to get it back, by beating one foot against the other. When we got\\nup, as soon as we could, as we did every night, for our bags were nearly\\nimpossible, it was blowing fairly hard and looked like blizzing. We had a\\nlot to do, two or three hours\' work, packing sledges and making a dep\xf4t\\nof what we did not want, in a corner of the igloo. We left the second\\nsledge, and a note tied to the handle of the pickaxe.\\n\\"We started down the slope in a wind which was rising all the time and\\n-15\xb0. My job was to balance the sledge behind: I was so utterly done I\\ndon\'t believe I could have pulled effectively. Birdie was much the\\nstrongest of us. The strain and want of sleep was getting me in the neck,\\nand Bill looked very bad. At the bottom we turned our faces to the\\nBarrier, our backs to the penguins, but after doing about a mile it\\nlooked so threatening in the south that we camped in a big wind, our\\nhands going one after the other. We had nothing but the hardest\\nwind-swept sastrugi, and it was a long business: there was only the\\nsmallest amount of drift, and we were afraid the icy snow blocks would\\nchafe the tent. Birdie lashed the full biscuit tin to the door to\\nprevent its flapping, and also got what he called the tent downhaul round\\nthe cap and then tied it about himself outside his bag: if the tent went\\nhe was going too.\\n\\"I was feeling as if I should crack, and accepted Birdie\'s eider-down. It\\nwas wonderfully self-sacrificing of him: more than I can write. I felt a\\nbrute to take it, but I was getting useless unless I got some sleep which\\nmy big bag would not allow. Bill and Birdie kept on telling me to do\\nless: that I was doing more than my share of the work: but I think that I\\nwas getting more and more weak. Birdie kept wonderfully strong: he slept\\nmost of the night: the difficulty for him was to get into his bag without\\ngoing to sleep. He kept the meteorological log untiringly, but some of\\nthese nights he had to give it up for the time because he could not keep\\nawake. He used to fall asleep with his pannikin in his hand and let it\\nfall: and sometimes he had the primus.\\n\\"Bill\'s bag was getting hopeless: it was really too small for an\\neider-down and was splitting all over the place: great long holes. He\\nnever consciously slept for nights: he did sleep a bit, for we heard him.\\nExcept for this night, and the next when Birdie\'s eider-down was still\\nfairly dry, I never consciously slept; except that I used to wake for\\nfive or six nights running with the same nightmare--that we were drifted\\nup, and that Bill and Birdie were passing the gear into my bag, cutting\\nit open to do so, or some other variation,--I did not know that I had\\nbeen asleep at all.\\"[161]\\n\\"We had hardly reached the pit,\\" wrote Bowers, \\"when a furious wind came\\non again and we had to camp. All that night the tent flapped like the\\nnoise of musketry, owing to two poles having been broken at the ends and\\nthe fit spoilt. I thought it would end matters by going altogether and\\nlashed it down as much as I could, attaching the apex to a line round my\\nown bag. The wind abated after 1\xbd days and we set out, doing five or six\\nmiles before we found ourselves among crevasses.\\"[162]\\nWe had plugged ahead all that day (July 26) in a terrible light,\\nblundering in among pressure and up on to the slopes of Terror. The\\ntemperature dropped from -21\xb0 to -45\xb0. \\"Several times [we] stepped into\\nrotten-lidded crevasses in smooth wind-swept ice. We continued, however,\\nfeeling our way along by keeping always off hard ice-slopes and on the\\ncrustier deeper snow which characterizes the hollows of the pressure\\nridges, which I believed we had once more fouled in the dark. We had no\\nlight, and no landmarks to guide us, except vague and indistinct\\nsilhouetted slopes ahead, which were always altering and whose distance\\nand character it was impossible to judge. We never knew whether we were\\napproaching a steep slope at close quarters or a long slope of Terror,\\nmiles away, and eventually we travelled on by the ear, and by the feel of\\nthe snow under our feet, for both the sound and the touch told one much\\nof the chances of crevasses or of safe going. We continued thus in the\\ndark in the hope that we were at any rate in the right direction.\\"[163]\\nAnd then we camped after getting into a bunch of crevasses, completely\\nlost. Bill said, \\"At any rate I think we are well clear of the pressure.\\"\\nBut there were pressure pops all night, as though some one was whacking\\nan empty tub.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.15","output":"{\\n    \\"summary\\": \\"The explorers face many difficulties trying to cross the ice and are forced to develop new techniques to get themselves out of crevasses.\\",\\n    \\"excerpt_1\\": \\"Bill stumbled one foot into a crevasse and I landed in it with both mine, the bridge gave way and down I went.\\",\\n    \\"excerpt_2\\": \\"This day I had a distinct idea that we were to have one more bad experience and that after that we could hope for better things.\\",\\n    \\"text_to_image\\": \\"A group of explorers harnessed to a sledge are visible in the distance, plowing through heavy snow towards a mountain range that is only just visible through thick fog.\\"\\n}","parsed":{"summary":"The explorers face many difficulties trying to cross the ice and are forced to develop new techniques to get themselves out of crevasses.","excerpt_1":"Bill stumbled one foot into a crevasse and I landed in it with both mine, the bridge gave way and down I went.","excerpt_2":"This day I had a distinct idea that we were to have one more bad experience and that after that we could hope for better things.","text_to_image":"A group of explorers harnessed to a sledge are visible in the distance, plowing through heavy snow towards a mountain range that is only just visible through thick fog."},"passage":"It was Birdie\'s picture hat which made the trouble next day. \\"What do you\\nthink of _that_ for a hat, sir?\\" I heard him say to Scott a few days\\nbefore we started, holding it out much as Lucille displays her latest\\nParis model. Scott looked at it quietly for a time: \\"I\'ll tell you when\\nyou come back, Birdie,\\" he said. It was a complicated affair with all\\nkinds of nose-guards and buttons and lanyards: he thought he was going to\\nset it to suit the wind much as he would set the sails of a ship. We\\nspent a long time with our housewifes before this and other trips, for\\neverybody has their own ideas as to how to alter their clothing for the\\nbest. When finished some looked neat, like Bill: others baggy, like Scott\\nor Seaman Evans: others rough and ready, like Oates and Bowers: a few\\nperhaps more rough than ready, and I will not mention names. Anyway\\nBirdie\'s hat became improper immediately it was well iced up.\\n\\"When we got a little light in the morning we found we were a little\\nnorth of the two patches of moraine on Terror. Though we did not know it,\\nwe were on the point where the pressure runs up against Terror, and we\\ncould dimly see that we were right up against something. We started to\\ntry and clear it, but soon had an enormous ridge, blotting out the\\nmoraine and half Terror, rising like a great hill on our right. Bill said\\nthe only thing was to go right on and hope it would lower; all the time,\\nhowever, there was a bad feeling that we might be putting any number of\\nridges between us and the mountain. After a while we tried to cross this\\none, but had to turn back for crevasses, both Bill and I putting a leg\\ndown. We went on for about twenty minutes and found a lower place, and\\nturned to rise up it diagonally, and reached the top. Just over the top\\nBirdie went right down a crevasse, which was about wide enough to take\\nhim. He was out of sight and out of reach from the surface, hanging in\\nhis harness. Bill went for his harness, I went for the bow of the sledge:\\nBill told me to get the Alpine rope and Birdie directed from below what\\nwe could do. We could not possibly haul him up as he was, for the sides\\nof the crevasse were soft and he could not help himself.\\"[164]\\n\\"My helmet was so frozen up,\\" wrote Bowers, \\"that my head was encased in\\na solid block of ice, and I could not look down without inclining my\\nwhole body. As a result Bill stumbled one foot into a crevasse and I\\nlanded in it with both mine [even as I shouted a warning[165] ], the\\nbridge gave way and down I went. Fortunately our sledge harness is made\\nwith a view to resisting this sort of thing, and there I hung with the\\nbottomless pit below and the ice-crusted sides alongside, so narrow that\\nto step over it would have been quite easy had I been able to see it.\\nBill said, \'What do you want?\' I asked for an Alpine rope with a bowline\\nfor my foot: and taking up first the bowline and then my harness they got\\nme out.\\"[166] Meanwhile on the surface I lay over the crevasse and gave\\nBirdie the bowline: he put it on his foot: then he raised his foot,\\ngiving me some slack: I held the rope while he raised himself on his\\nfoot, thus giving Bill some slack on the harness: Bill then held the\\nharness, allowing Birdie to raise his foot and give me some slack again.\\nWe got him up inch by inch, our fingers getting bitten, for the\\ntemperature was -46\xb0. Afterwards we often used this way of getting people\\nout of crevasses, and it was a wonderful piece of presence of mind that\\nit was invented, so far as I know, on the spur of the moment by a frozen\\nman hanging in one himself.\\n\\"In front of us we could see another ridge, and we did not know how many\\nlay beyond that. Things looked pretty bad. Bill took a long lead on the\\nAlpine rope and we got down our present difficulty all right. This method\\nof the leader being on a long trace in front we all agreed to be very\\nuseful. From this moment our luck changed and everything went for us to\\nthe end. When we went out on the sea-ice the whole experience was over in\\na few days, Hut Point was always in sight, and there was daylight. I\\nalways had the feeling that the whole series of events had been brought\\nabout by an extraordinary run of accidents, and that after a certain\\nstage it was quite beyond our power to guide the course of them. When on\\nthe way to Cape Crozier the moon suddenly came out of the cloud to show\\nus a great crevasse which would have taken us all with our sledge without\\nany difficulty, I felt that we were not to go under this trip after such\\na deliverance. When we had lost our tent, and there was a very great\\nbalance of probability that we should never find it again, and we were\\nlying out the blizzard in our bags, I saw that we were face to face with\\na long fight against cold which we could not have survived. I cannot\\nwrite how helpless I believed we were to help ourselves, and how we were\\nbrought out of a very terrible series of experiences. When we started\\nback I had a feeling that things were going to change for the better, and\\nthis day I had a distinct idea that we were to have one more bad\\nexperience and that after that we could hope for better things.\\n[Illustration: DOWN A CREVASSE]\\n\\"By running along the hollow we cleared the pressure ridges, and\\ncontinued all day up and down, but met no crevasses. Indeed, we met no\\nmore crevasses and no more pressure. I think it was upon this day that a\\nwonderful glow stretched over the Barrier edge from Cape Crozier: at the\\nbase it was the most vivid crimson it is possible to imagine, shading\\nupwards through every shade of red to light green, and so into a deep\\nblue sky. It is the most vivid red I have ever seen in the sky.\\"[167]\\nIt was -49\xb0 in the night and we were away early in -47\xb0. By mid-day we\\nwere rising Terror Point, opening Erebus rapidly, and got the first\\nreally light day, though the sun would not appear over the horizon for\\nanother month. I cannot describe what a relief the light was to us. We\\ncrossed the point outside our former track, and saw inside us the ridges\\nwhere we had been blizzed for three days on our outward journey.\\nThe minimum was -66\xb0 the next night and we were now back in the windless\\nbight of Barrier with its soft snow, low temperatures, fogs and mists,\\nand lingering settlements of the inside crusts. Saturday and Sunday, the\\n29th and 30th, we plugged on across this waste, iced up as usual but\\nalways with Castle Rock getting bigger. Sometimes it looked like fog or\\nwind, but it always cleared away. We were getting weak, how weak we can\\nonly realize now, but we got in good marches, though slow--days when we\\ndid 4\xbd, 7\xbc 6\xbe, 6\xbd, 7\xbd miles. On our outward journey we had been relaying\\nand getting forward about 4\xbd miles a day at this point. The surface which\\nwe had dreaded so much was not so sandy or soft as when we had come out,\\nand the settlements were more marked. These are caused by a crust falling\\nunder your feet. Generally the area involved is some twenty yards or so\\nround you, and the surface falls through an air space for two or three\\ninches with a soft \'crush\' which may at first make you think there are\\ncrevasses about. In the region where we now travelled they were much more\\npronounced than elsewhere, and one day, when Bill was inside the tent\\nlighting the primus, I put my foot into a hole that I had dug. This\\nstarted a big settlement; sledge, tent and all of us dropped about a\\nfoot, and the noise of it ran away for miles and miles: we listened to it\\nuntil we began to get too cold. It must have lasted a full three minutes.\\nIn the pauses of our marching we halted in our harnesses the ropes of\\nwhich lay slack in the powdery snow. We stood panting with our backs\\nagainst the mountainous mass of frozen gear which was our load. There was\\nno wind, at any rate no more than light airs: our breath crackled as it\\nfroze. There was no unnecessary conversation: I don\'t know why our\\ntongues never got frozen, but all my teeth, the nerves of which had been\\nkilled, split to pieces. We had been going perhaps three hours since\\nlunch.\\n\\"How are your feet, Cherry?\\" from Bill.\\n\\"Very cold.\\"\\n\\"That\'s all right; so are mine.\\" We didn\'t worry to ask Birdie: he never\\nhad a frost-bitten foot from start to finish.\\nHalf an hour later, as we marched, Bill would ask the same question. I\\ntell him that all feeling has gone: Bill still has some feeling in one of\\nhis but the other is lost. He settled we had better camp: another ghastly\\nnight ahead. We started to get out of our harnesses, while Bill, before\\ndoing anything else, would take the fur mitts from his hands, carefully\\nshape any soft parts as they froze (generally, however, our mitts did not\\nthaw on our hands), and lay them on the snow in front of him--two dark\\ndots. His proper fur mitts were lost when the igloo roof went: these were\\nthe delicate dog-skin linings we had in addition, beautiful things to\\nlook at and to feel when new, excellent when dry to turn the screws of a\\ntheodolite, but too dainty for straps and lanyards. Just now I don\'t know\\nwhat he could have done without them.","image":null},{"merge":"C07.16","output":"1.

This was\\nalso fitted to be used as a sail, but we never could have rigged a sail\\non this journey. The shovel and the bamboos, with a lining, itself lined\\nwith ice, lashed to them, were packed on the top of the load and were now\\nput on the snow until wanted. Our next job was to lift our three\\nsleeping-bags one by one on to the floor-cloth: they covered it, bulging\\nover the sides--those obstinate coffins which were all our life to us....\\nOne of us is off by now to nurse his fingers back. The cooker was\\nunlashed from the top of the instrument box; some parts of it were put on\\nthe bags with the primus, methylated spirit can, matches and so forth;\\nothers left to be filled with snow later. Taking a pole in each hand we\\nthree spread the bamboos over the whole. \\"All right? Down!\\" from Bill;\\nand we lowered them gently on to the soft snow, that they might not sink\\ntoo far. The ice on the inner lining of the tent was formed mostly from\\nthe steam of the cooker. This we had been unable to beat or chip off in\\nthe past, and we were now, truth to tell, past worrying about it. The\\nlittle ventilator in the top, made to let out this steam, had been tied\\nup in order to keep in all possible heat. Then over with the outer cover,\\nand for one of us the third worst job of the day was to begin. The worst\\njob was to get into our bags: the second or equal worst was to lie in\\nthem for six hours (we had brought it down to six): this third worst was,\\nto get the primus lighted and a meal on the way.\\nAs cook of the day you took the broken metal framework, all that remained\\nof our candlestick, and got yourself with difficulty into the funnel\\nwhich formed the door. The enclosed space of the tent seemed much colder\\nthan the outside air: you tried three or four match-boxes and no match\\nwould strike: almost desperate, you asked for a new box to be given you\\nfrom the sledge and got a light from this because it had not yet been in\\nthe warmth, so called, of the tent. The candle hung by a wire from the\\ncap of the tent. It would be tedious to tell of the times we had getting\\nthe primus alight, and the lanyards of the weekly food bag unlashed.\\nProbably by now the other two men have dug in the tent; squared up\\noutside; filled and passed in the cooker; set the thermometer under the\\nsledge and so forth. There were always one or two odd jobs which wanted\\ndoing as well: but you may be sure they came in as soon as possible when\\nthey heard the primus hissing, and saw the glow of light inside. Birdie\\nmade a bottom for the cooker out of an empty biscuit tin to take the\\nplace of the part which was blown away. On the whole this was a success,\\nbut we had to hold it steady--on Bill\'s sleeping-bag, for the flat frozen\\nbags spread all over the floor space. Cooking was a longer business now.\\nSome one whacked out the biscuit, and the cook put the ration of pemmican\\ninto the inner cooker which was by now half full of water. As opportunity\\noffered we got out of our day, and into our night foot-gear--fleecy\\ncamel-hair stockings and fur boots. In the dim light we examined our feet\\nfor frost-bite.\\nI do not think it took us less than an hour to get a hot meal to our\\nlips: pemmican followed by hot water in which we soaked our biscuits. For\\nlunch we had tea and biscuits: for breakfast, pemmican, biscuits and tea.\\nWe could not have managed more food bags--three were bad enough, and the\\nlashings of everything were like wire. The lashing of the tent door,\\nhowever, was the worst, and it _had_ to be tied tightly, especially if it\\nwas blowing. In the early days we took great pains to brush rime from the\\ntent before packing it up, but we were long past that now.\\nThe hoosh got down into our feet: we nursed back frost-bites: and we were\\nall the warmer for having got our dry foot-gear on before supper. Then we\\nstarted to get into our bags.\\n[Illustration: PANORAMA AND MAP OF THE WINTER JOURNEY--Copied at Hut\\nPoint by Apsley Cherry-Garrard from a drawing by E. A. Wilson]\\nBirdie\'s bag fitted him beautifully, though perhaps it would have been a\\nlittle small with an eider-down inside. He must have had a greater heat\\nsupply than other men; for he never had serious trouble with his feet,\\nwhile ours were constantly frost-bitten: he slept, I should be afraid to\\nsay how much, longer than we did, even in these last days: it was a\\npleasure, lying awake practically all night, to hear his snores. He\\nturned his bag inside out from fur to skin, and skin to fur, many times\\nduring the journey, and thus got rid of a lot of moisture which came\\nout as snow or actual knobs of ice. When we did turn our bags the only\\nway was to do so directly we turned out, and even then you had to be\\nquick before the bag froze. Getting out of the tent at night it was quite\\na race to get back to your bag before it hardened. Of course this was in\\nthe lowest temperatures.\\nWe could not burn our bags and we tried putting the lighted primus into\\nthem to thaw them out, but this was not very successful. Before this\\ntime, when it was very cold, we lighted the primus in the morning while\\nwe were still in our bags: and in the evening we kept it going until we\\nwere just getting or had got the mouths of our bags levered open. But\\nreturning we had no oil for such luxuries, until the last day or two.\\nI do not believe that any man, however sick he is, has a much worse time\\nthan we had in those bags, shaking with cold until our backs would almost\\nbreak. One of the added troubles which came to us on our return was the\\nsodden condition of our hands in our bags at night. We had to wear our\\nmitts and half-mitts, and they were as wet as they could be: when we got\\nup in the morning we had washer-women\'s hands--white, crinkled, sodden.\\nThat was an unhealthy way to start the day\'s work. We really wanted some\\nbags of saennegrass for hands as well as feet; one of the blessings of\\nthat kind of bag being that you can shake the moisture from it: but we\\nonly had enough for our wretched feet.\\nThe horrors of that return journey are blurred to my memory and I know\\nthey were blurred to my body at the time. I think this applies to all of\\nus, for we were much weakened and callous. The day we got down to the\\npenguins I had not cared whether I fell into a crevasse or not. We had\\nbeen through a great deal since then. I know that we slept on the march;\\nfor I woke up when I bumped against Birdie, and Birdie woke when he\\nbumped against me. I think Bill steering out in front managed to keep\\nawake. I know we fell asleep if we waited in the comparatively warm tent\\nwhen the primus was alight--with our pannikins or the primus in our\\nhands. I know that our sleeping-bags were so full of ice that we did not\\nworry if we spilt water or hoosh over them as they lay on the\\nfloor-cloth, when we cooked on them with our maimed cooker. They were so\\nbad that we never rolled them up in the usual way when we got out of them\\nin the morning: we opened their mouths as much as possible before they\\nfroze, and hoisted them more or less flat on to the sledge. All three of\\nus helped to raise each bag, which looked rather like a squashed coffin\\nand was probably a good deal harder. I know that if it was only -40\xb0 when\\nwe camped for the night we considered quite seriously that we were going\\nto have a warm one, and that when we got up in the morning if the\\ntemperature was in the minus sixties we did not enquire what it was. The\\nday\'s march was bliss compared to the night\'s rest, and both were awful.\\nWe were about as bad as men can be and do good travelling: but I never\\nheard a word of complaint, nor, I believe, an oath, and I saw\\nself-sacrifice standing every test.\\nAlways we were getting nearer home: and we were doing good marches. We\\nwere going to pull through; it was only a matter of sticking this for a\\nfew more days; six, five, four ... three perhaps now, if we were not\\nblizzed. Our main hut was behind that ridge where the mist was always\\nforming and blowing away, and there was Castle Rock: we might even see\\nObservation Hill to-morrow, and the Discovery Hut furnished and trim was\\nbehind it, and they would have sent some dry sleeping-bags from Cape\\nEvans to greet us there. We reckoned our troubles over at the Barrier\\nedge, and assuredly it was not far away. \\"You\'ve got it in the neck,\\nstick it, you\'ve got it in the neck\\"--it was always running in my head.\\nAnd we _did_ stick it. How good the memories of those days are. With\\njokes about Birdie\'s picture hat: with songs we remembered off the\\ngramophone: with ready words of sympathy for frost-bitten feet: with\\ngenerous smiles for poor jests: with suggestions of happy beds to come.\\nWe did not forget the Please and Thank you, which mean much in such\\ncircumstances, and all the little links with decent civilization which\\nwe could still keep going. I\'ll swear there was still a grace about us\\nwhen we staggered in.

A hell of a morning we had: -57\xb0 in\\nour present state. But it was calm, and the Barrier edge could not be\\nmuch farther now. The surface was getting harder: there were a few\\nwind-blown furrows, the crust was coming up to us. The sledge was\\ndragging easier: we always suspected the Barrier sloped downwards\\nhereabouts. Now the hard snow was on the surface, peeping out like great\\ninverted basins on which we slipped, and our feet became warmer for not\\nsinking into soft snow. Suddenly we saw a gleam of light in a line of\\ndarkness running across our course. It was the Barrier edge: we were all\\nright now.\\nWe ran the sledge off a snow-drift on to the sea-ice, with the same cold\\nstream of air flowing down it which wrecked my hands five weeks ago:\\npushed out of this, camped and had a meal: the temperature had already\\nrisen to -43\xb0. We could almost feel it getting warmer as we went round\\nCape Armitage on the last three miles. We managed to haul our sledge up\\nthe ice foot, and dug the drift away from the door. The old hut struck us\\nas fairly warm.\\nBill was convinced that we ought not to go into the warm hut at Cape\\nEvans when we arrived there--to-morrow night! We ought to get back to\\nwarmth gradually, live in a tent outside, or in the annexe for a day or\\ntwo. But I\'m sure we never meant to do it. Just now Hut Point did not\\nprejudice us in favour of such abstinence. It was just as we had left it:\\nthere was nothing sent down for us there--no sleeping-bags, nor sugar:\\nbut there was plenty of oil. Inside the hut we pitched a dry tent left\\nthere since Dep\xf4t Journey days, set two primuses going in it; sat dozing\\non our bags; and drank cocoa without sugar so thick that next morning we\\nwere gorged with it. We were very happy, falling asleep between each\\nmouthful, and after several hours discussed schemes of not getting into\\nour bags at all. But some one would have to keep the primus going to\\nprevent frost-bite, and we could not trust ourselves to keep awake. Bill\\nand I tried to sing a part-song. Finally we sopped our way into our bags.\\nWe only stuck _them_ three hours, and thankfully turned out at 3 A.M.,\\nand were ready to pack up when we heard the wind come away. It was no\\ngood, so we sat in our tent and dozed again. The wind dropped at 9.30: we\\nwere off at 11. We walked out into what seemed to us a blaze of light. It\\nwas not until the following year that I understood that a great part of\\nsuch twilight as there is in the latter part of the winter was cut off\\nfrom us by the mountains under which we travelled. Now, with nothing\\nbetween us and the northern horizon below which lay the sun, we saw as we\\nhad not seen for months, and the iridescent clouds that day were\\nbeautiful.\\nWe just pulled for all we were worth and did nearly two miles an hour:\\nfor two miles a baddish salt surface, then big undulating hard sastrugi\\nand good going. We slept as we walked. We had done eight miles by 4 P.M.\\nand were past Glacier Tongue. We lunched there.\\nAs we began to gather our gear together to pack up for the last time,\\nBill said quietly, \\"I want to thank you two for what you have done. I\\ncouldn\'t have found two better companions--and what is more I never\\nshall.\\"\\nI am proud of that.\\nAntarctic exploration is seldom as bad as you imagine, seldom as bad as\\nit sounds. But this journey had beggared our language: no words could\\nexpress its horror.\\nWe trudged on for several more hours and it grew very dark. There was a\\ndiscussion as to where Cape Evans lay. We rounded it at last: it must\\nhave been ten or eleven o\'clock, and it was possible that some one might\\nsee us as we pulled towards the hut. \\"Spread out well,\\" said Bill, \\"and\\nthey will be able to see that there are three men.\\" But we pulled along\\nthe cape, over the tide-crack, up the bank to the very door of the hut\\nwithout a sound. No noise from the stable, nor the bark of a dog from the\\nsnowdrifts above us. We halted and stood there trying to get ourselves\\nand one another out of our frozen harnesses--the usual long job. The door\\nopened--\\"Good God! here is the Crozier Party,\\" said a voice, and\\ndisappeared.\\nThus ended the worst journey in the world.\\nAnd now the reader will ask what became of the three penguins\' eggs for\\nwhich three human lives had been risked three hundred times a day, and\\nthree human frames strained to the utmost extremity of human endurance.\\nLet us leave the Antarctic for a moment and conceive ourselves in the\\nyear 1913 in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington.

I did not take a verbatim report of his welcome; but\\nthe spirit of it may be dramatized as follows:\\nFIRST CUSTODIAN. Who are you? What do you want? This ain\'t an egg-shop.\\nWhat call have you to come meddling with our eggs? Do you want me to put\\nthe police on to you? Is it the crocodile\'s egg you\'re after? I don\'t\\nknow nothing about \'no eggs. You\'d best speak to Mr. Brown: it\'s him that\\nvarnishes the eggs.\\nI resort to Mr. Brown, who ushers me into the presence of the Chief\\nCustodian, a man of scientific aspect, with two manners: one, affably\\ncourteous, for a Person of Importance (I guess a Naturalist Rothschild at\\nleast) with whom he is conversing, and the other, extraordinarily\\noffensive even for an official man of science, for myself.\\nI announce myself with becoming modesty as the bearer of the penguins\'\\neggs, and proffer them. The Chief Custodian takes them into custody\\nwithout a word of thanks, and turns to the Person of Importance to\\ndiscuss them. I wait. The temperature of my blood rises. The conversation\\nproceeds for what seems to me a considerable period. Suddenly the Chief\\nCustodian notices my presence and seems to resent it.\\nCHIEF CUSTODIAN. You needn\'t wait.\\nHEROIC EXPLORER. I should like to have a receipt for the eggs, if you\\nplease.\\nCHIEF CUSTODIAN. It is not necessary: it is all right. You needn\'t wait.\\nHEROIC EXPLORER. I should like to have a receipt.\\nBut by this time the Chief Custodian\'s attention is again devoted wholly\\nto the Person of Importance. Feeling that to persist in overhearing their\\nconversation would be an indelicacy, the Heroic Explorer politely leaves\\nthe room, and establishes himself on a chair in a gloomy passage outside,\\nwhere he wiles away the time by rehearsing in his imagination how he will\\ntell off the Chief Custodian when the Person of Importance retires. But\\nthis the Person of Importance shows no sign of doing, and the Explorer\'s\\nthoughts and intentions become darker and darker. As the day wears on,\\nminor officials, passing to and from the Presence, look at him doubtfully\\nand ask his business. The reply is always the same, \\"I am waiting for a\\nreceipt for some penguins\' eggs.\\" At last it becomes clear from the\\nExplorer\'s expression that what he is really waiting for is not to take a\\nreceipt but to commit murder. Presumably this is reported to the destined\\nvictim: at all events the receipt finally comes; and the Explorer goes\\nhis way with it, feeling that he has behaved like a perfect gentleman,\\nbut so very dissatisfied with that vapid consolation that for hours he\\ncontinues his imaginary rehearsals of what he would have liked to have\\ndone to that Custodian (mostly with his boots) by way of teaching him\\nmanners.\\nSome time after this I visited the Natural History Museum with Captain\\nScott\'s sister. After a slight preliminary skirmish in which we convinced\\na minor custodian that the specimens brought by the expedition from the\\nAntarctic did not include the moths we found preying on some of them,\\nMiss Scott expressed a wish to see the penguins\' eggs. Thereupon the\\nminor custodians flatly denied that any such eggs were in existence or in\\ntheir possession. Now Miss Scott was her brother\'s sister; and she showed\\nso little disposition to take this lying down that I was glad to get her\\naway with no worse consequences than a profanely emphasized threat on my\\npart that if we did not receive ample satisfaction in writing within\\ntwenty-four hours as to the safety of the eggs England would reverberate\\nwith the tale.\\nThe ultimatum was effectual; and due satisfaction was forthcoming in\\ntime; but I was relieved when I learnt later on that they had been\\nentrusted to Professor Assheton for the necessary microscopic\\nexamination. But he died before he could approach the task; and the eggs\\npassed into the hands of Professor Cossar Ewart of Edinburgh University.\\nHis report is as follows:\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [150] See pp. xxxix-xlv.\\n   [151] A thermometer which registered -77\xb0 at the Winter Quarters\\n         of H.M.S.

But though\\nembryos were conspicuous by their absence in the Emperor eggs brought\\nhome by the National Antarctic Expedition, it is well to bear in mind\\nthat the naturalists on board the Discovery learned much about the\\nbreeding habits of the largest living member of the ancient penguin\\nfamily. Amongst other things it was ascertained (1) that in the case of\\nthe Emperor, as in the King Penguin, the egg during the period of\\nincubation rests on the upper surface of the feet protected and kept in\\nposition by a fold of skin from the lower breast; and (2) that in the\\ncase of the Emperor the whole process of incubation is carried out on sea\\nice during the coldest and darkest months of the antarctic winter.\\n\\"After devoting much time to the study of penguins Dr. Wilson came to the\\nconclusion that Emperor embryos would throw new light on the origin and\\nhistory of birds, and decided that if he again found his way to the\\nAntarctic he would make a supreme effort to visit an Emperor rookery\\nduring the breeding season. When, and under what conditions, the Cape\\nCrozier rookery was eventually visited and Emperor eggs secured is\\ngraphically told in The Winter Journey. The question now arises, Has \'the\\nweirdest bird\'s-nesting expedition that has ever been made\' added\\nappreciably to our knowledge of birds?\\n\\"It is admitted that birds are descended from bipedal reptiles which\\nflourished some millions of years ago--reptiles in build not unlike the\\nkangaroo. From Archaeopteryx of Jurassic times we know primeval birds had\\nteeth, three fingers with claws on each hand, and a long lizard-like tail\\nprovided with nearly twenty pairs of well-formed true feathers. But\\nunfortunately neither this lizard-tailed bird, nor yet the fossil birds\\nfound in America, throw any light on the origin of feathers.\\nOrnithologists and others who have devoted much time to the study of\\nbirds have as a rule assumed that feathers were made out of scales, that\\nthe scales along the margin of the hand and forearm and along each side\\nof the tail were elongated, frayed and otherwise modified to form the\\nwing and tail quills, and that later other scales were altered to provide\\na coat capable of preventing loss of heat. But as it happens, a study of\\nthe development of feathers affords no evidence that they were made out\\nof scales. There are neither rudiments of scales nor feathers in very\\nyoung bird embryos. In the youngest of the three Emperor embryos there\\nare, however, feather rudiments in the tail region,--the embryo was\\nprobably seven or eight days old--but in the two older embryos there are\\na countless number of feather rudiments, i.e. of minute pimples known\\nas papillae.\\n\\"In penguins as in many other birds there are two distinct crops of\\nfeather papillae, viz.: a crop of relatively large papillae which develop\\ninto prepennae, the forerunners of true feathers (pennae), and a crop of\\nsmall papillae which develop into preplumulae, the forerunners of true\\ndown feathers (plumulae).\\n\\"In considering the origin of feathers we are not concerned with the true\\nfeathers (pennae), but with the nestling feathers (prepennae), and more\\nespecially with the papillae from which the prepennae are developed. What\\nwe want to know is, Do the papillae which in birds develop into the\\nfirst generation of feathers correspond to the papillae which in lizards\\ndevelop into scales?\\n\\"The late Professor Assheton, who undertook the examination of some of\\nthe material brought home by the Terra Nova, made a special study of the\\nfeather papillae of the Emperor Penguin embryos from Cape Crozier.\\nDrawings were made to indicate the number, size and time of appearance of\\nthe feather papillae, but unfortunately in the notes left by the\\ndistinguished embryologist there is no indication whether the feather\\npapillae were regarded as modified scale papillae or new creations\\nresulting from the appearance of special feather-forming factors in the\\ngerm-plasm.\\n\\"When eventually the three Emperor Penguin embryos reached me that their\\nfeather rudiments might be compared with the feather rudiments of other\\nbirds, I noticed that in Emperor embryos the feather papillae appeared\\nbefore the scale papillae. Evidence of this was especially afforded by\\nthe largest embryo, which had reached about the same stage in its\\ndevelopment as a 16-days goose embryo.\\n\\"In the largest Emperor embryo feather papillae occur all over the\\nhind-quarters and on the legs to within a short distance of the tarsal\\njoint. Beyond the tarsal joint even in the largest embryo no attempt had\\nbeen made to produce the papillae which in older penguin embryos\\nrepresent, and ultimately develop into, the scaly covering of the foot.\\nThe absence of papillae on the foot implied either that the scale\\npapillae were fundamentally different from feather papillae or that for\\nsome reason or other the development of the papillae destined to give\\nrise to the foot scales had been retarded. There is no evidence as far as\\nI can ascertain that in modern lizards the scale papillae above the\\ntarsal joint appear before the scale papillae beyond this joint.\\n\\"The absence of papillae below the tarsal joint in Emperor embryos,\\ntogether with the fact that in many birds each large feather papilla is\\naccompanied by two or more very small feather papillae, led me to study\\nthe papillae of the limbs of other birds. The most striking results were\\nobtained from the embryos of Chinese geese in which the legs are\\nrelatively longer than in penguins. In a 13-days goose embryo the whole\\nof the skin below and for some distance above the tarsal joint is quite\\nsmooth, whereas the skin of the rest of the leg is studded with feather\\npapillae. On the other hand, in an 18-days goose embryo in which the\\nfeather papillae of the legs have developed into filaments, each\\ncontaining a fairly well-formed feather, scale papillae occur not only on\\nthe foot below and for some distance above the tarsal joint but also\\nbetween the roots of the feather filaments between the tarsal and the\\nknee joints. More important still, in a 20-days goose embryo a number of\\nthe papillae situated between the feather filaments of the leg were\\nactually developing into scales each of which overlapped the root\\n(calamus) of a feather just as scales overlap the foot feathers in grouse\\nand other feather-footed birds.\\n\\"As in bird embryos there is no evidence that feather papillae ever\\ndevelop into scales or that scale papillae ever develop into feathers it\\nmay be assumed that feather papillae are fundamentally different from\\nscale papillae, the difference presumably being due to the presence of\\nspecial factors in the germ-plasm. Just as in armadillos hairs are found\\nemerging from under the scales, in ancient birds as in the feet of some\\nmodern birds the coat probably consisted of both feathers and scales. But\\nin course of time, owing perhaps to the growth of the scales being\\narrested, the coat of the birds, instead of consisting throughout of\\nwell-developed scales and small inconspicuous feathers, was almost\\nentirely made up of a countless number of downy feathers, well-developed\\nscales only persisting below the tarsal joint.\\n\\"If the conclusions arrived at with the help of the Emperor Penguin\\nembryos about the origin of feathers are justified, the worst journey in\\nthe world in the interest of science was not made in vain.\\"\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nEND OF VOLUME ONE\\n_Printed in Great Britain by_ R. & R.

My toes\\nare very bulbous and some toe-nails are coming off. My left heel is one\\nbig burst blister. Going straight out of a warm bed into a strong wind\\noutside nearly bowled me over. I felt quite faint, and pulled myself\\ntogether thinking it was all nerves: but it began to come on again and I\\nhad to make for the hut as quickly as possible. Birdie is now full of\\nschemes for doing the trip again next year. Bill says it is too great a\\nrisk in the darkness, and he will not consider it, though he thinks that\\nto go in August might be possible.\\"[169]\\nAnd again a day or two later:\\n\\"I came in covered with a red rash which is rather ticklish. My ankles\\nand knees are a bit puffy, but my feet are not so painful as Bill\'s and\\nBirdie\'s. Hands itch a bit. We must be very weak and worn out, though I\\nthink Birdie is the strongest of us. He seems to be picking up very\\nquickly. Bill is still very worn and rather haggard. The kindness of\\neverybody would spoil an angel.\\"[170]\\nI have put these personal experiences down from my diary because they are\\nthe only contemporary record I possess. Scott\'s own diary at this time\\ncontains the statement: \\"The Crozier party returned last night after\\nenduring for five weeks the hardest conditions on record. They looked\\nmore weather-worn than any one I have yet seen. Their faces were scarred\\nand wrinkled, their eyes dull, their hands whitened and creased with the\\nconstant exposure to damp and cold, yet the scars of frost-bite were\\nvery few ... to-day after a night\'s rest our travellers are very\\ndifferent in appearance and mental capacity.\\"[171]\\n\\"Atch has been lost in a blizzard,\\" was the news which we got as soon as\\nwe could grasp anything. Since then he has spent a year of war in the\\nNorth Sea, seen the Dardanelles campaign, and much fighting in France,\\nand has been blown up in a monitor. I doubt whether he does not reckon\\nthat night the worst of the lot. He ought to have been blown into\\nhundreds of little bits, but always like some hardy indiarubber ball he\\nturns up again, a little dented, but with the same tough elasticity which\\nrefuses to be hurt. And with the same quiet voice he volunteers for the\\nnext, and tells you how splendid everybody was except himself.\\nIt was the blizzard of July 4, when we were lying in the windless bight\\non our way to Cape Crozier, and we knew it must be blowing all round us.\\nAt any rate it was blowing at Cape Evans, though it eased up in the\\nafternoon, and Atkinson and Taylor went up the Ramp to read the\\nthermometers there. They returned without great difficulty, and some\\ndiscussion seems to have arisen as to whether it was possible to read the\\ntwo screens on the sea-ice. Atkinson said he would go and read that in\\nNorth Bay: Gran said he was going to South Bay. They started\\nindependently at 5.30 P.M. Gran returned an hour and a quarter\\nafterwards. He had gone about two hundred yards.\\nAtkinson had not gone much farther when he decided that he had better\\ngive it up, so he turned and faced the wind, steering by keeping it on\\nhis cheek. We discovered afterwards that the wind does not blow quite in\\nthe same direction at the end of the Cape as it does just where the hut\\nlies. Perhaps it was this, perhaps his left leg carried him a little\\nfarther than his right, perhaps it was that the numbing effect of a\\nblizzard on a man\'s brain was already having its effect, certainly\\nAtkinson does not know himself, but instead of striking the Cape which\\nran across his true front, he found himself by an old fish trap which he\\nknew was 200 yards out on the sea-ice. He made a great effort to steady\\nhimself and make for the Cape, but any one who has stood in a blizzard\\nwill understand how difficult that is. The snow was a blanket raging all\\nround him, and it was quite dark. He walked on, and found nothing.\\nEverything else is vague. Hour after hour he staggered about: he got his\\nhand badly frost-bitten: he found pressure: he fell over it: he was\\ncrawling in it, on his hands and knees. Stumbling, tumbling, tripping,\\nbuffeted by the endless lash of the wind, sprawling through miles of\\npunishing snow, he still seems to have kept his brain working. He found\\nan island, thought it was Inaccessible, spent ages in coasting along it,\\nlost it, found more pressure, and crawled along it. He found another\\nisland, and the same horrible, almost senseless, search went on. Under\\nthe lee of some rocks he waited for a time. His clothing was thin though\\nhe had his wind-clothes, and, a horrible thought if this was to go on, he\\nhad boots on his feet instead of warm finnesko. Here also he kicked out a\\nhole in a drift where he might have more chance if he were forced to lie\\ndown. For sleep is the end of men who get lost in blizzards. Though he\\ndid not know it he must now have been out more than four hours.\\nThere was little chance for him if the blizzard continued, but hope\\nrevived when the moon showed in a partial lull. It is wonderful that he\\nwas sufficiently active to grasp the significance of this, and groping\\nback in his brain he found he could remember the bearing of the moon from\\nCape Evans when he went to bed the night before. The hut must be\\nsomewhere over there: this must be Inaccessible Island! He left the\\nisland and made in that direction, but the blizzard came down again with\\nadded force and the moon was blotted out. He tried to return to the\\nisland and failed: then he stumbled on another island, perhaps the same\\none, and waited. Again the lull came, and again he set off, and walked\\nand walked, until he recognized Inaccessible Island on his left. Clearly\\nhe must have been under Great Razorback Island and this is some four\\nmiles from Cape Evans. The moon still showed, and on he walked and then\\nat last he saw a flame.","image":null},{"merge":"C09.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"Atkinson gets lost during a blizzard, but is found unharmed after wandering around for six hours.

I\\nfeel convinced that most of these blizzards are local affairs. The party\\nwhich had gone north returned at 9.30 without news, and Scott became\\nseriously alarmed. Between 9.30 and 10 six search parties started out.\\nBut time was passing and Atkinson had been away more than six hours.\\nThe light which Atkinson had seen was a flare of tow soaked in petrol lit\\nby Day at Cape Evans. He corrected his course and before long was under\\nthe rock upon which Day could be seen working like some lanky devil in\\none of Dante\'s hells. Atkinson shouted again and again but could not\\nattract his attention, and finally walked almost into the hut before he\\nwas found by two men searching the Cape. \\"It was all my own damned\\nfault,\\" he said, \\"but Scott never slanged me at all.\\" I really think we\\nshould all have been as merciful! Wouldn\'t _you_?\\nAnd that was that: but he had a beastly hand.\\nTheoretically the sun returned to us on August 23. Practically there was\\nnothing to be seen except blinding drift. But we saw his upper limb two\\ndays later. In Scott\'s words the daylight came \\"rushing\\" at us. Two\\nspring journeys were contemplated; and with preparations for the Polar\\nJourney, and the ordinary routine work of the station, everybody had as\\nmuch on his hands as he could get through.\\nLieutenant Evans, Gran and Forde volunteered to go out to Corner Camp and\\ndig out this dep\xf4t as well as that of Safety Camp. They started on\\nSeptember 9 and camped on the sea-ice beyond Cape Armitage that night,\\nthe minimum temperature being -45\xb0. They dug out Safety Camp next\\nmorning, and marched on towards Corner Camp. The minimum that night was\\n-62.3\xb0. The next evening they made their night camp as a blizzard was\\ncoming up, the temperature at the same time being -34.5\xb0 and minimum for\\nthe night -40\xb0. This is an extremely low temperature for a blizzard. They\\nmade a start in a very cold wind the next afternoon (September 12) and\\ncamped at 8.30 P.M. That night was bitterly cold and they found that the\\nminimum showed -73.3\xb0 for that night. Evans reports adversely on the use\\nof the eider-down bag and inner tent, but here none of our Winter Journey\\nmen would agree with him.[172] Most of September 13th was spent in\\ndigging out Corner Camp which they left at 5 P.M., intending to travel\\nback to Hut Point without stopping except for meals. They marched all\\nthrough that night with two halts for meals and arrived at Hut Point at 3\\nP.M. on September 14, having covered a distance of 34.6 statute miles.\\nThey reached Cape Evans the following day after an absence of 6\xbd\\ndays.[173]\\nDuring this journey Forde got his hand badly frost-bitten which\\nnecessitated his return in the Terra Nova in March 1912. He owed a good\\ndeal to the skilful treatment Atkinson gave it.\\nWilson was still looking grey and drawn some days, and I was not too fit,\\nbut Bowers was indefatigable. Soon after we got in from Cape Crozier he\\nheard that Scott was going over to the Western Mountains: somehow or\\nother he persuaded Scott to take him, and they started with Seaman Evans\\nand Simpson on September 15 on what Scott calls \\"a remarkably pleasant\\nand instructive little spring journey,\\"[174] and what Bowers called a\\njolly picnic.\\nThis picnic started from the hut in a -40\xb0 temperature, dragging 180 lbs.\\nper man, mainly composed of stores for the geological party of the\\nsummer. They penetrated as far north as Dunlop Island and turned back\\nfrom there on September 24, reaching Cape Evans on September 29, marching\\ntwenty-one miles (statute) into a blizzard wind with occasional storms of\\ndrift and a temperature of -16\xb0: and they marched a little too long; for\\na storm of drift came against them and they had to camp. It is never very\\neasy pitching a tent on sea-ice because there is not very much snow on\\nthe ice: on this occasion it was only after they had detached the inner\\ntent, which was fastened to the bamboos, that they could hold the\\nbamboos, and then it was only inch by inch that they got the outer cover\\non. At 9 P.M. the drift took off though the wind was as strong as ever,\\nand they decided to make for Cape Evans. They arrived at 1.15 A.M. after\\none of the most strenuous days which Scott could remember: and that meant\\na good deal. Simpson\'s face was a sight! During his absence Griffith\\nTaylor became meteorologist-in-chief. He was a greedy scientist, and he\\nalso wielded a fluent pen. Consequently his output during the year and a\\nhalf which he spent with us was large, and ranged from the results of the\\ntwo excellent scientific journeys which he led in the Western Mountains,\\nto this work during the latter half of September. He was a most valued\\ncontributor to The South Polar Times, and his prose and poetry both had a\\nbite which was never equalled by any other of our amateur journalists.\\nWhen his pen was still, his tongue wagged, and the arguments he led were\\nlegion. The hut was a merrier place for his presence. When the weather\\nwas good he might be seen striding over the rocks with a complete\\ndisregard of the effect on his clothes: he wore through a pair of boots\\nquicker than anybody I have ever known, and his socks had to be mended\\nwith string. Ice movement and erosion were also of interest to him, and\\nalmost every day he spent some time in studying the slopes and huge\\nice-cliffs of the Barne Glacier, and other points of interest. With equal\\nferocity he would throw himself into his curtained bunk because he was\\nbored, or emerge from it to take part in some argument which was\\ntroubling the table. His diary must have been almost as long as the\\nreports he wrote for Scott of his geological explorations. He was a\\ndemon note-taker, and he had a passion for being equipped so that he\\ncould cope with any observation which might turn up. Thus Old Griff on a\\nsledge journey might have notebooks protruding from every pocket, and\\nhung about his person, a sundial, a prismatic compass, a sheath knife, a\\npair of binoculars, a geological hammer, chronometer, pedometer, camera,\\naneroid and other items of surveying gear, as well as his goggles and\\nmitts. And in his hand might be an ice-axe which he used as he went along\\nto the possible advancement of science, but the certain disorganization\\nof his companions.\\nHis gaunt, untamed appearance was atoned for by a halo of good-fellowship\\nwhich hovered about his head. I am sure he must have been an untidy\\nperson to have in your tent: I feel equally sure that his tent-mates\\nwould have been sorry to lose him. His gear took up more room than was\\nstrictly his share, and his mind also filled up a considerable amount of\\nspace. He always bulked large, and when he returned to the Australian\\nGovernment, which had lent him for the first two sledging seasons, he\\nleft a noticeable gap in our company.\\nFrom the time we returned from Cape Crozier until now Scott had been full\\nof buck. Our return had taken a weight off his mind: the return of the\\ndaylight was stimulating to everybody: and to a man of his impatient and\\nimpetuous temperament the end of the long period of waiting was a relief.\\nAlso everything was going well. On September 10 he writes with a sigh of\\nrelief that the detailed plans for the Southern Journey are finished at\\nlast. \\"Every figure has been checked by Bowers, who has been an enormous\\nhelp to me. If the motors are successful, we shall have no difficulty in\\ngetting to the Glacier, and if they fail, we shall still get there with\\nany ordinary degree of good fortune. To work three units of four men from\\nthat point onwards requires no small provision, but with the proper\\nprovision it should take a good deal to stop the attainment of our\\nobject. I have tried to take every reasonable possibility of misfortune\\ninto consideration, and to so organize the parties as to be prepared to\\nmeet them. I fear to be too sanguine, yet taking everything into\\nconsideration I feel that our chances ought to be good.\\"[175]\\nAnd again he writes: \\"Of hopeful signs for the future none are more\\nremarkable than the health and spirit of our people. It would be\\nimpossible to imagine a more vigorous community, and there does not seem\\nto be a single weak spot in the twelve good men and true who are chosen\\nfor the Southern advance. All are now experienced sledge travellers, knit\\ntogether with a bond of friendship that has never been equalled under\\nsuch circumstances. Thanks to these people, and more especially to Bowers\\nand Petty Officer Evans, there is not a single detail of our equipment\\nwhich is not arranged with the utmost care and in accordance with the\\ntests of experience.\\"[176]","image":null},{"merge":"C09.03","output":"This passage describes the preparations and difficulties faced by the expedition in the month leading up to their departure to the South Pole.

Not only had he all the details of stores at his\\nfinger-tips, but he had studied polar clothing and polar food, was full\\nof plans and alternative plans, and, best of all, refused to be beaten by\\nany problem which presented itself. The actual distribution of weights\\nbetween dogs, motors and ponies, and between the different ponies, was\\nlargely left in his hands. We had only to lead our ponies out on the day\\nof the start and we were sure to find our sledges ready, each with the\\nright load and weight. To the leader of an expedition such a man was\\nworth his weight in gold.\\nBut now Scott became worried and unhappy. We were running things on a\\nfine margin of transport, and during the month before we were due to\\nstart mishap followed mishap in the most disgusting way. Three men were\\nmore or less incapacitated: Forde with his frozen hand, Clissold who\\nconcussed himself by a fall from a berg, and Debenham who hurt his knee\\nseriously when playing foot-ball. One of the ponies, Jehu, was such a\\ncrock that at one time it was decided not to take him out at all: and\\nvery bad opinions were also held of Chinaman. Another dog died of a\\nmysterious disease. \\"It is trying,\\" writes Scott, \\"but I am past\\ndespondency. Things must take their course.\\"[177] And \\"if this waiting\\nwere to continue it looks as though we should become a regular party of\\n\'crocks.\'\\"[178]\\nThen on the top of all this came a bad accident to one of the motor axles\\non the eve of departure. \\"To-night the motors were to be taken on to the\\nfloe. The drifts made the road very uneven, and the first and best motor\\noverrode its chain; the chain was replaced and the machine proceeded, but\\njust short of the floe was thrust to a steep inclination by a ridge, and\\nthe chain again overrode the sprockets; this time by ill fortune Day\\nslipped at the critical moment and without intention jammed the throttle\\nfull on. The engine brought up, but there was an ominous trickle of oil\\nunder the back axle, and investigation showed that the axle casing\\n(aluminium) had split. The casing had been stripped and brought into the\\nhut: we may be able to do something to it, but time presses. It all goes\\nto show that we want more experience and workshops. I am secretly\\nconvinced that we shall not get much help from the motors, yet nothing\\nhas ever happened to them that was unavoidable. A little more care and\\nforesight would make them splendid allies. The trouble is that if they\\nfail, no one will ever believe this.\\"[179]\\nIn the meantime Meares and Dimitri ran out to Corner Camp from Hut Point\\ntwice with the two dog-teams. The first time they journeyed out and back\\nin two days and a night, returning on October 15; and another very\\nsimilar run was made before the end of the month.\\nThe motor party was to start first, but was delayed until October 24.\\nThey were to wait for us in latitude 80\xb0 30\xb4, man-hauling certain loads\\non if the motors broke down. The two engineers were Day and Lashly, and\\ntheir two helpers, who steered by pulling on a rope in front, were\\nLieutenant Evans and Hooper. Scott was \\"immensely eager that these\\ntractors should succeed, even though they may not be of great help to our\\nSouthern advance. A small measure of success will be enough to show their\\npossibilities, their ability to revolutionize polar transport.\\"[180]\\nLashly, as the reader may know by now, was a chief stoker in the Navy,\\nand accompanied Scott on his Plateau Journey in the Discovery days. The\\nfollowing account of the motors\' chequered career is from his diary, and\\nfor permission to include here both it and the story of the adventures of\\nthe Second Return Party, an extraordinarily vivid and simple narrative, I\\ncannot be too grateful.\\nAfter the motors had been two days on the sea-ice on their way to Hut\\nPoint Lashly writes on 26th October 1911:\\n\\"Kicked off at 9.30; engine going well, surface much better, dropped one\\ncan of petrol each and lubricating oil, lunched about two miles from Hut\\nPoint. Captain Scott and supporting party came from Cape Evans to help us\\nover blue ice, but they were not required. Got away again after lunch but\\nwas delayed by the other sledge not being able to get along, it is\\nbeginning to dawn on me the sledges are not powerful enough for the work\\nas it is one continual drag over this sea-ice, perhaps it will improve on\\nthe barrier, it seems we are going to be troubled with engine\\noverheating; after we have run about three-quarters to a mile it is\\nnecessary to stop at least half an hour to cool the engine down, then we\\nhave to close up for a few minutes to allow the carbrutta to warm up or\\nwe can\'t get the petrol to vaporize; we are getting new experiences every\\nday. We arrived at Hut Point and proceeded to Cape Armitage it having\\ncome on to snow pretty thickly, so we pitched our tent and waited for the\\nother car to come up, she has been delayed all the afternoon and not made\\nmuch headway. At 6.30 Mr. Bowers and Mr. Garrard came out to us and told\\nus to come back to Hut Point for the night, where we all enjoyed\\nourselves with a good hoosh and a nice night with all hands.\\n\\n    \\"_27th October 1911._\\n\\"This morning being fine made our way out to the cars and got them going\\nafter a bit of trouble, the temperature being a bit low. I got away in\\ngood style, the surface seems to be improving, it is better for running\\non but very rough and the overheating is not overcome nor likely to be as\\nfar as I can see. Just before arriving at the Barrier my car began to\\ndevelop some strange knocking in the engine, but with the help of the\\nparty with us I managed to get on the Barrier, the other car got up the\\nslope in fine style and waited for me to come up; as my engine is giving\\ntrouble we decided to camp, have lunch and see what is the matter. On\\nopening the crank chamber we found the crank brasses broke into little\\npieces, so there is nothing left to do but replace them with the spare\\nones; of course this meant a cold job for Mr. Day and myself, as handling\\nmetal on the Barrier is not a thing one looks forward to with pleasure.\\nAnyhow we set about it after Lieutenant Evans and Hooper had rigged up a\\nscreen to shelter us a bit, and by 10 P.M. we were finished and ready to\\nproceed, but owing to a very low temperature we found it difficult to get\\nthe engines to go, so we decided to camp for the night.\\n\\n    \\"_28th October 1911._\\n\\"Turned out and had another go at starting which took some little time\\nowing again to the low temperature. We got away but again the trouble is\\nalways staring us in the face, overheating, and the surface is so bad and\\nthe pull so heavy and constant that it looks we are in for a rough time.\\nWe are continually waiting for one another to come up, and every time we\\nstop something has to be done, my fan got jammed and delayed us some\\ntime, but have got it right again. Mr. Evans had to go back for his spare\\ngear owing to some one [not] bringing it out in mistake; he had a good\\ntramp as we were about 15 miles out from Hut Point.\\n\\n    \\"_29th October 1911._\\n\\"Again we got away, but did not get far before the other car began to\\ngive trouble. I went back to see what was the matter, it seems the petrol\\nis dirty due perhaps to putting in a new drum, anyhow got her up and\\ncamped for lunch. After lunch made a move, and all seemed to be going\\nwell when Mr. Day\'s car gave out at the crank brasses the same as mine,\\nso we shall have to see what is the next best thing to do.\\n\\n    \\"_30th October 1911._\\n\\"This morning before getting the car on the way had to reconstruct our\\nloads as Mr. Day\'s car is finished and no more use for further service.\\nWe have got all four of us with one car now, things seems to be going\\nfairly well, but we are still troubled with the overheating which means\\nto say half our time is wasted. We can see dawning on us the harness\\nbefore long. We covered seven miles and camped for the night.

Then proceeded to\\ndig out some of the provisions, we have to take on all the man food we\\ncan, this is a wild-looking place no doubt, have not seen anything of the\\nponies.\\n\\n    \\"_9th November 1911._\\n\\"To-day we have started on the second stage of our journey. Our orders\\nare to proceed one degree south of One Ton Dep\xf4t and wait for the ponies\\nand dogs to come up with us; as we have been making good distances each\\nday, the party will hardly overtake us, but we have found to-day the load\\nis much heavier to drag. We have just over 200 lbs. per man, and we have\\nbeen brought up on several occasions, and to start again required a\\npretty good strain on the rope, anyhow we done 10\xbd miles, a pretty good\\nshow considering all things.\\n\\n    \\"_10th November 1911._\\n\\"Again we started off with plenty of vim, but it was jolly tough work,\\nand it begins to tell on all of us; the surface to-day is covered with\\nsoft crystals which don\'t improve things. To-night Hooper is pretty well\\ndone up, but he have stuck it well and I hope he will, although he could\\nnot tackle the food in the best of spirits, we know he wanted it. Mr.\\nEvans, Mr. Day and myself could eat more, as we are just beginning to\\nfeel the tightening of the belt. Made good 11\xbc miles and we are now\\nbuilding cairns all the way, one about three miles: then again at lunch\\nand one in the afternoon and one at night. This will keep us employed.\\n\\n    \\"_11th November 1911._\\n\\"To-day it has been very heavy work. The surface is very bad and we are\\npretty well full up, but not with food; man-hauling is no doubt the\\nhardest work one can do, no wonder the motor sledges could not stand it.\\nI have been thinking of the trials I witnessed of the motor engines in\\nWolseley\'s works in Birmingham, they were pretty stiff but nothing\\ncompared to the drag of a heavy load on the Barrier surface.\\n\\n    \\"_12th November 1911._\\n\\"To-day have been similar to the two previous days, but the light have\\nbeen bad and snow have been falling which do not improve the surface; we\\nhave been doing 10 miles a day Geographical and quite enough too as we\\nhave all had enough by time it goes Camp.\\n\\n    \\"_13th November 1911._\\n\\"The weather seems to be on the change. Should not be surprised if we\\ndon\'t get a blizzard before long, but of course we don\'t want that.\\nHooper seems a bit fagged but he sticks it pretty well. Mr. Day keeps on\\nplodding, his only complaint is should like a little more to eat.\\n\\n    \\"_14th November 1911._\\n\\"When we started this morning Mr. Evans said we had about 15 miles to go\\nto reach the required distance. The hauling have been about the same,\\nbut the weather is somewhat finer and the blizzard gone off. We did 10\\nmiles and camped; have not seen anything of the main party yet but shall\\nnot be surprised to see them at any time.\\n\\n    \\"_15th November 1911._\\n\\"We are camped after doing five miles where we are supposed to be [lat.\\n80\xb0 32\xb4]; now we have to wait the others coming up. Mr. Evans is quite\\nproud to think we have arrived before the others caught us, but we don\'t\\nexpect they will be long although we have nothing to be ashamed of as our\\ndaily distance have been good.

A. C.-G.\\n(All miles are geographical unless otherwise stated.)\\n\\nI. THE BARRIER STAGE\\nThe departure from Cape Evans at 11 P.M. on November 1 is described by\\nGriffith Taylor, who started a few days later on the second Geological\\nJourney with his own party:\\n\\"On the 31st October the pony parties started. Two weak ponies led by\\nAtkinson and Keohane were sent off first at 4.30, and I accompanied them\\nfor about a mile. Keohane\'s pony rejoiced in the name of Jimmy Pigg, and\\nhe stepped out much better than his fleeter-named mate Jehu. We heard\\nthrough the telephone of their safe arrival at Hut Point.\\n\\"Next morning the Southern Party finished their mail, posting it in the\\npacking case on Atkinson\'s bunk, and then at 11 A.M. the last party were\\nready for the Pole. They had packed the sledges overnight, and they took\\n20 lbs. personal baggage. The Owner had asked me what book he should\\ntake. He wanted something fairly filling. I recommended Tyndall\'s\\nGlaciers--if he wouldn\'t find it \'coolish.\' He didn\'t fancy this! So then\\nI said, \'Why not take Browning, as I\'m doing?\' And I believe that he did\\nso.\\n\\"Wright\'s pony was the first harnessed to its sledge. Chinaman is Jehu\'s\\nrival for last place, and as some compensation is easy to harness. Seaman\\nEvans led Snatcher, who used to rush ahead and take the lead as soon as\\nhe was harnessed. Cherry had Michael, a steady goer, and Wilson led\\nNobby--the pony rescued from the killer whales in March. Scott led out\\nSnippets to the sledges, and harnessed him to the foremost, with little\\nAnton\'s help--only it turned out to be Bowers\' sledge! However he\\ntransferred in a few minutes and marched off rapidly to the south.\\nChristopher, as usual, behaved like a demon. First they had to trice his\\nfront leg up tight under his shoulder, then it took five minutes to throw\\nhim. The sledge was brought up and he was harnessed in while his head was\\nheld down on the floe. Finally he rose up, still on three legs, and\\nstarted off galloping as well as he was able. After several violent kicks\\nhis foreleg was released, and after more watch-spring flicks with his\\nhind legs he set off fairly steadily. Titus can\'t stop him when once he\\nhas started, and will have to do the fifteen miles in one lap probably!\\n\\"Dear old Titus--that was my last memory of him. Imperturbable as ever;\\nnever hasty, never angry, but soothing that vicious animal, and\\ndetermined to get the best out of most unpromising material in his\\nendeavour to do his simple duty.\\n\\"Bowers was last to leave. His pony, Victor, nervous but not vicious, was\\nsoon in the traces. I ran to the end of the Cape and watched the little\\ncavalcade--already strung out into remote units--rapidly fade into the\\nlonely white waste to southward.\\n\\"That evening I had a chat with Wilson over the telephone from the\\nDiscovery Hut--my last communication with those five gallant\\nspirits.\\"[181]\\nAll the ponies arrived at Hut Point by 4 P.M., just in time to escape a\\nstiff blow. Three of them were housed with ourselves inside the hut, the\\nrest being put into the verandah. The march showed that with their loads\\nthe speed of the different ponies varied to such an extent that\\nindividuals were soon separated by miles. \\"It reminded me of a regatta or\\na somewhat disorganized fleet with ships of very unequal speed.\\"[182]\\nIt was decided to change to night marching, and the following evening we\\nproceeded in the following order, which was the way of our going for the\\npresent. The three slowest ponies started first, namely, Jehu with\\nAtkinson, Chinaman with Wright, James Pigg with Keohane. This party was\\nknown as the Baltic Fleet.\\nTwo hours later Scott\'s party followed; Scott with Snippets, Wilson with\\nNobby, and myself with Michael.\\nBoth these parties camped for lunch in the middle of the night\'s march.\\nAfter another hour the remaining four men set to work to get Christopher\\ninto his sledge; when he was started they harnessed in their own ponies\\nas quickly as possible and followed, making a non-stop run right through\\nthe night\'s march. It was bad for men and ponies, but it was impossible\\nto camp in the middle of the march owing to Christopher. The composition\\nof this party was, Oates with Christopher, Bowers with Victor, Seaman\\nEvans with Snatcher, Crean with Bones.\\nEach of these three parties was self-contained with tent, cooker and\\nweekly bag, and the times of starting were so planned that the three\\nparties arrived at the end of the march about the same time.\\nThere was a strong head wind and low drift as we rounded Cape Armitage on\\nour way to the Barrier and the future. Probably there were few of us who\\ndid not wonder when we should see the old familiar place again.\\nScott\'s party camped at Safety Camp as the Baltic fleet were getting\\nunder weigh again. Soon afterwards Ponting appeared with a dog sledge and\\na cinematograph,--how anomalous it seemed--which \\"was up in time to catch\\nthe flying rearguard which came along in fine form, Snatcher leading and\\nbeing stopped every now and again--a wonderful little beast. Christopher\\nhad given the usual trouble when harnessed, but was evidently subdued by\\nthe Barrier Surface. However, it was not thought advisable to halt him,\\nand so the party fled through in the wake of the advance guard.\\"[183]\\nImmediately afterwards Scott\'s party packed up. \\"Good-bye and good luck,\\"\\nfrom Ponting, a wave of the hand not holding in a frisky pony and we had\\nleft the last link with the hut. \\"The future is in the lap of the gods; I\\ncan think of nothing left undone to deserve success.\\"[184]\\nThe general scheme was to average 10 miles (11.5 statute) a day from Hut\\nPoint to One Ton Dep\xf4t with the ponies lightly laden. From One Ton to the\\nGateway a daily average of 13 miles (15 statute) was necessary to carry\\ntwenty-four weekly units of food for four men each to the bottom of the\\nglacier. This was the Barrier Stage of the journey, a distance of 369\\nmiles (425 statute) as actually run on our sledge-meter. The twenty-four\\nweekly units of food were to carry the Polar Party and two supporting\\nparties forward to their farthest point, and back again to the bottom of\\nthe Beardmore, where three more units were to be left in a dep\xf4t.[185]","image":null},{"merge":"C10.02","output":"The passage describes the team\'s journey across the Barrier, including their use of motor-driven machines and ponies, as well as the weather conditions they faced.

But the next day we passed five petrol drums which had been\\ndumped. This meant that there was trouble, and some 14 miles from Hut\\nPoint we learned that the big end of the No. 2 cylinder of Day\'s motor\\nhad broken, and half a mile beyond we found the motor itself, drifted up\\nwith snow, and looking a mournful wreck. The next day\'s march (Sunday,\\nNovember 5, A.M.) brought us to Corner Camp. There were a few legs down\\ncrevasses during the day but nothing to worry about.\\nFrom here we could see to the South an ominous mark in the snow which we\\nhoped might not prove to be the second motor. It was: \\"the big end of No.\\n1 cylinder had cracked, the machine otherwise in good order. Evidently\\nthe engines are not fitted to working in this climate, a fact that should\\nbe certainly capable of correction. One thing is proved; the system of\\npropulsion is altogether satisfactory.\\"[186] And again: \\"It is a\\ndisappointment. I had hoped better of the machines once they got away on\\nthe Barrier Surface.\\"[187]\\nScott had set his heart upon the success of the motors. He had run them\\nin Norway and Switzerland; and everything was done that care and\\nforethought could suggest. At the back of his mind, I feel sure, was the\\nwish to abolish the cruelty which the use of ponies and dogs necessarily\\nentails. \\"A small measure of success will be enough to show their\\npossibilities, their ability to revolutionize polar transport. Seeing the\\nmachines at work to-day [leaving Cape Evans] and remembering that every\\ndefect so far shown is purely mechanical, it is impossible not to be\\nconvinced of their value. But the trifling mechanical defects and lack of\\nexperience show the risk of cutting out trials. A season of experiment\\nwith a small workshop at hand may be all that stands between success and\\nfailure.\\"[188] I do not believe that Scott built high hopes on these\\nmotors: but it was a chance to help those who followed him. Scott was\\nalways trying to do that.\\nDid they succeed or fail? They certainly did not help us much, the motor\\nwhich travelled farthest drawing a heavy load to just beyond Corner Camp.\\nBut even so fifty statute miles is fifty miles, and that they did it at\\nall was an enormous advance. The distance travelled included hard and\\nsoft surfaces, and we found later when the snow bridges fell in during\\nthe summer that this car had crossed safely some broad crevasses. Also\\nthey worked in temperatures down to -30\xb0 Fahr. All this was to the good,\\nfor no motor-driven machine had travelled on the Barrier before. The\\ngeneral design seemed to be right, all that was now wanted was\\nexperience. As an experiment they were successful in the South, but Scott\\nnever knew their true possibilities; for they were the direct ancestors\\nof the \'tanks\' in France.\\nNight-marching had its advantages and disadvantages. The ponies were\\npulling in the colder part of the day and resting in the warm, which was\\ngood. Their coats dried well in the sun, and after a few days to get\\naccustomed to the new conditions, they slept and fed in comparative\\ncomfort. On the other hand the pulling surface was undoubtedly better\\nwhen the sun was high and the temperature warmer. Taking one thing with\\nanother there was no doubt that night-marching was better for ponies, but\\nwe seldom if ever tried it man-hauling.\\n[Illustration: CAMP ON THE BARRIER--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nJust now there was an amazing difference between day and night\\nconditions. At midnight one was making short work of everything, nursing\\nfingers after doing up harness with minus temperatures and nasty cold\\nwinds: by supper time the next morning we were sitting on our sledges\\nwriting up our diaries or meteorological logs, and even dabbling our bare\\ntoes in the snow, but not for long! Shades of darkness! How different all\\nthis was from what we had been through. My personal impression of this\\nearly summer sledging on the Barrier was one of constant wonder at its\\ncomfort. One had forgotten that a tent could be warm and a sleeping-bag\\ndry: so deep were the contrary impressions that only actual experience\\nwas convincing. \\"It is a sweltering day, the air breathless, the glare\\nintense--one loses sight of the fact that the temperature is low [-22\xb0],\\none\'s mind seeks comparison in hot sunlit streets and scorching\\npavements, yet six hours ago my thumb was frost-bitten. All the\\ninconveniences of frozen footwear and damp clothes and sleeping-bags have\\nvanished entirely.\\"[189]\\nWe could not expect to get through this windy area of Corner Camp without\\nsome bad weather. The wind-blown surface improved, the ponies took their\\nheavier loads with ease, but as we came to our next camp it was banking\\nup to the S.E. and the breeze freshened almost immediately. We built pony\\nwalls hurriedly and by the time we had finished supper it was blowing\\nforce 5 (A.M. November 6, Camp 4). There was a moderate gale with some\\ndrift all day which increased to force 8 with more drift at night. It was\\nimpossible to march. The drift took off a bit the next morning, and\\nMeares and Dimitri with the two dog-teams appeared and camped astern of\\nus. This was according to previous plan by which the dog-teams were to\\nstart after us and catch us up, since they travelled faster than the\\nponies. \\"The snow and drift necessitated digging out ponies again and\\nagain to keep them well sheltered from the wind. The walls made a\\nsplendid lee, but some sledges at the extremities were buried altogether,\\nand our tent being rather close to windward of our wall got the back eddy\\nand was continually being snowed up above the door. After noon the snow\\nceased except for surface drift. Snatcher knocked his section of the wall\\nover, and Jehu did so more than ever. All ponies looked pretty miserable,\\nas in spite of the shelter they were bunged up, eyes and all, in drift\\nwhich had become ice and could not be removed without considerable\\ndifficulty.\\"[190]\\nTowards evening it ceased drifting altogether, but a wind, force 4, kept\\nup with disconcerting regularity. Eventually Atkinson\'s party got away at\\nmidnight. \\"Castle Rock is still visible, but will be closed by the north\\nend of White Island in the next march--then good-bye to the old landmarks\\nfor many a long day.\\"[191]\\nThe next day (November 8-9) \\"started at midnight and had a very pleasant\\nmarch. Truly sledging in such weather is great. Mounts Discovery and\\nMorning, which we gradually closed, looked fine in the general panorama\\nof mountains. We are now nearly abreast the north end of the Bluff. We\\nall came up to camp together this morning: it looked like a meet of the\\nhounds, and Jehu ran away!!!\\"[192]\\nThe next march was just the opposite. Wind force 5 to 6 and falling snow.\\n\\"The surface was very slippery in parts and on the hard sastrugi it was a\\ncase of falling or stumbling continually. The light got so bad that one\\nmight have been walking in the clouds for all that could be discerned,\\nand yet it was only snowing slightly. The Bluff became completely\\nobscured, and the usual signs of a blizzard were accentuated.\\n\\"At lunch camp Scott packed up and followed us. We overhauled Atkinson\\nabout 1\xbd hours later, he having camped, and we were not sorry, as in\\naddition to marching against a fresh southerly breeze the light brought a\\ntremendous strain on the eyes in following tracks.\\"[193] A little more\\nthan eight miles for the day\'s total.","image":null},{"merge":"C10.03","output":"The explorers continue to struggle through difficult weather and terrain with their ponies but eventually reach One Ton Depot, where they make the decision to abandon the idea of taking the ponies up the glacier.

In the big gale coming South when the ship nearly\\nsank, and when we lost one of the cherished motors through the sea-ice,\\nhis was one of the few cheerful faces I saw. Even when the ship ran\\naground off Cape Evans he was not despondent. But this kind of thing\\nirked him. Bowers wrote: \\"The unpleasant weather and bad surface, and\\nChinaman\'s indisposition, combined to make the outlook unpleasant, and on\\narrival [in camp] I was not surprised to find that Scott had a grievance.\\nHe felt that in arranging the consumption of forage his own unit had not\\nbeen favoured with the same reduction as ours, in fact accused me of\\nputting upon his three horses to save my own. We went through the weights\\nin detail after our meal, and, after a certain amount of argument,\\ndecided to carry on as we were going. I can quite understand his\\nfeelings, and after our experience of last year a bad day like this makes\\nhim fear our beasts are going to fail us. The Talent [i.e. the doctors]\\nexamined Chinaman, who begins to show signs of wear. Poor ancient little\\nbeggar, he ought to be a pensioner instead of finishing his days on a job\\nof this sort. Jehu looks pretty rocky too, but seeing that we did not\\nexpect him to reach the Glacier Tongue, and that he has now done more\\nthan 100 miles from Cape Evans, one really does not know what to expect\\nof these creatures. Certainly Titus thinks, as he has always said, that\\nthey are the most unsuitable scrap-heap crowd of unfit creatures that\\ncould possibly be got together.\\"[197]\\n\\"The weather was about as poisonous as one could wish; a fresh breeze and\\ndriving snow from the E. with an awful surface. The recently fallen snow\\nthickly covered the ground with powdery stuff that the unfortunate ponies\\nfairly wallowed in. If it was only ourselves to consider I should not\\nmind a bit, but to see our best ponies being hit like this at the start\\nis most distressing. A single march like that of last night must shorten\\ntheir usefulness by days, and here we are a fortnight out, and barely\\none-third of the distance to the glacier covered, with every pony showing\\nsigns of wear. Victor looks a lean and lanky beast compared with his\\ncondition two weeks ago.\\"[198]\\nBut the ponies began to go better; and it was about this time that Jehu\\nwas styled the Barrier Wonder, and Chinaman the Thunderbolt. \\"Our four\\nponies have suffered most,\\" writes Bowers. \\"I don\'t agree with Titus that\\nit is best to march them right through without a lunch camp. They were\\nundoubtedly pretty tired, and worst of all did not go their feeds\\nproperly. It was a fine warm morning for them (Nov. 13); +15\xb0, our\\nwarmest temperature hitherto. In the afternoon it came on to snow in\\nlarge flakes like one would get at home. I have never seen such snow down\\nhere before; it makes the surface very bad for the sledges. The ponies\'\\nmanes and rugs were covered in little knots of ice.\\"\\nThe next march (November 13-14) was rather better, though the going was\\nvery deep and heavy, and all the ponies were showing signs of wear and\\ntear. This was followed by a delightfully warm day, and all the animals\\nwere standing drowsily in the sunshine. We could see the land far away\\nbehind us, the first sight of land we had had for many days. On November\\n15 we reached One Ton Dep\xf4t, having travelled a hundred and thirty miles\\nfrom Hut Point.\\nThe two sledges left standing were still upright, and the tattered\\nremains of a flag flapped over the main cairn. In a salt tin lashed to\\nthe bamboo flag-pole was a note from Lieutenant Evans to say that he had\\ngone on with the motor party five days before, and would continue\\nman-hauling to 80\xb0 30\xb4 S. and await us there. \\"He has done something over\\n30 miles in 2\xbd days--exceedingly good going.\\"[199] We dug out the cairn,\\nwhich we found just as we had left it except that there was a big tongue\\nof drift, level with the top of the cairn to leeward, and running about\\n150 yards to N.E., showing that the prevailing wind here is S.W. Nine\\nmonths before we had sprinkled some oats on the surface of the snow\\nhoping to get a measurement of the accretion of snow during the winter.\\nUnfortunately we were unable to find the oats again, but other evidence\\nwent to show that the snow deposit was very small. A minimum thermometer\\nwhich was lashed with great care to a framework registered -73\xb0. After\\nthe temperatures already experienced by us on the Barrier during the\\nwinter and spring this was surprisingly high, especially as our minimum\\ntemperatures were taken under the sledge, which means that the\\nthermometer is shaded from radiation, while this thermometer at One Ton\\nwas left open to the sky. On the Winter Journey we found that a shaded\\nthermometer registered -69\xb0 when an unshaded one registered -75\xb0, a\\ndifference of 6\xb0. All the provisions left here were found to be in\\nexcellent condition.\\nWe then had a prolonged council of war. This meant that Scott called\\nBowers, and perhaps Oates, into our tent after supper was finished in the\\nmorning. Somehow these conferences were always rather serio-comic. On\\nthis occasion, as was usually the case, the question was ponies. It was\\ndecided to wait here one day and rest them, as there was ample food. The\\nmain discussion centred round the amount of forage to be taken on from\\nhere, while the state of the ponies, the amount they could pull and the\\ndistance they could go had to be taken into consideration.\\n\\"Oates thinks the ponies will get through, but that they have lost\\ncondition quicker than he expected. Considering his usually pessimistic\\nattitude this must be thought a hopeful view. Personally I am much more\\nhopeful. I think that a good many of the beasts are actually in better\\nform than when they started, and that there is no need to be alarmed\\nabout the remainder, always excepting the weak ones which we have always\\nregarded with doubt. Well, we must wait and see how things go.\\"[200]\\nThe decision made was to take just enough food to get the ponies to the\\nglacier, allowing for the killing of some of them before that date. It\\nwas obvious that Jehu and Chinaman could not go very much farther, and\\nit was also necessary that ponies should be killed in order to feed the\\ndogs. The two dog-teams were carrying about a week\'s pony food, but they\\nwere unable to advance more than a fortnight from One Ton without killing\\nponies.\\nThis decision practically meant that Scott abandoned the idea of taking\\nponies up the glacier. This was a great relief, for the crevassed state\\nof the lower reaches of the glacier as described by Shackleton led us to\\nbelieve that the attempt was suicidal. All the winter our brains were\\nexercised to try and devise some method by which the ponies could be\\ndriven from behind, and by which the connection between pony and sledge\\ncould be loosed if the pony fell into a crevasse, but I confess that\\nthere seemed little chance of this happening. From all we saw of the\\nglacier I am convinced that there is no reasonable chance of getting\\nponies up it, and that dogs could only be driven down it if the way up\\nwas most carefully surveyed and kept on the return. I am sure that in\\nthis kind of uncertainty the mental strain on the leader of a party is\\nless than that on his men. The leader knows quite well what he thinks\\nworth while risking or not: in this case Scott probably was always of the\\nopinion that it would not be worth while taking ponies on to the glacier.\\nThe pony leaders, however, only knew that the possibility was ahead of\\nthem. I can remember now the relief with which we heard that it was not\\nintended that Wilson should take Nobby, the fittest of our ponies,\\nfarther than the Gateway.","image":null},{"merge":"C10.04","output":"This passage includes diary entries detailing the capture and struggles of Christopher, the difficulties of sledging, and the routines and conversations that took place on the trip.

Below is a dome-shaped glare of white which contained an exaggerated mock sun as dazzling as the sun himself."},"passage":"Up to now Christopher had lived up to his reputation, as the following\\nextracts from Bowers\' diary will show: \\"Three times we downed him, and he\\ngot up and threw us about, with all four of us hanging on like grim\\ndeath. He nearly had me under him once; he seems fearfully strong, but it\\nis a pity he wastes so much good energy.... Christopher, as usual, was\\nstrapped on three legs and then got down on his knees. He gets more\\ncunning each time, and if he does not succeed in biting or kicking one of\\nus before long it won\'t be his fault. He finds the soft snow does not\\nhurt his knees like the sea-ice, and so plunges about on them _ad lib_.\\nOne\'s finnesko are so slippery that it is difficult to exert full\\nstrength on him, and to-day he bowled Oates over and got away altogether.\\nFortunately the lashing on his fourth leg held fast, and we were able to\\nsecure him when he rejoined the other animals. Finally he lay down, and\\nthought he had defeated us, but we had the sledge connected up by that\\ntime, and as he got up we rushed him forward before he had time to kick\\nover the traces.... Dimitri came and gave us a hand with Chris. Three of\\nus hung on to him while the other two connected up the sledge. We had a\\nstruggle for over twenty minutes, and he managed to tread on me, but no\\ndamage done.... Got Chris in by a dodge. Titus did away with his back\\nstrap, and nearly had him away unaided before he realized that the hated\\nsledge was fast to him. Unfortunately he started off just too soon, and\\nbolted with only one trace fast. This pivoted him to starboard, and he\\ncharged the line. I expected a mix-up, but he stopped at the wall between\\nBones and Snatcher, and we cast off and cleared sledge before trying\\nagain. By laying the traces down the side of the sledge instead of ahead\\nwe got him off his guard again, and he was away before he knew what had\\noccurred.... We had a bad time with Chris again. He remembered having\\nbeen bluffed before, and could not be got near the sledge at all. Three\\ntimes he broke away, but fortunately he always ran back among the other\\nponies, and not out on to the Barrier. Finally we had to down him, and he\\nwas so tired with his recent struggles that after one abortive attempt we\\ngot him fast and away.\\"\\nMeanwhile it was not so much the difficulties of sledging as the\\ndepressing blank conditions in which our march was so often made, that\\ngave us such troubles as we had. The routine of a tent makes a lot of\\ndifference. Scott\'s tent was a comfortable one to live in, and I was\\nalways glad when I was told to join it, and sorry to leave. He was\\nhimself extraordinarily quick, and no time was ever lost by his party in\\ncamping or breaking camp. He was most careful, some said over-careful\\nbut I do not think so, that everything should be neat and shipshape, and\\nthere was a recognized place for everything. On the Dep\xf4t Journey we were\\nbidden to see that every particle of snow was beaten off our clothing and\\nfinnesko before entering the tent: if it was drifting we had to do this\\nafter entering and the snow was carefully cleared off the floor-cloth.\\nAfterwards each tent was supplied with a small brush with which to\\nperform this office. In addition to other obvious advantages this\\nmaterially helped to keep clothing, finnesko, and sleeping-bags dry, and\\nthus prolong the life of furs. \\"After all is said and done,\\" said Wilson\\none day after supper, \\"the best sledger is the man who sees what has to\\nbe done, and does it--and says nothing about it.\\" Scott agreed. And if\\nyou were \\"sledging with the Owner\\" you had to keep your eyes wide open\\nfor the little things which cropped up, and do them quickly, and say\\nnothing about them. There is nothing so irritating as the man who is\\nalways coming in and informing all and sundry that he has repaired his\\nsledge, or built a wall, or filled the cooker, or mended his socks.\\nI moved into Scott\'s tent for the first time in the middle of the Dep\xf4t\\nJourney, and was enormously impressed by the comfort which a careful\\nroutine of this nature evoked. There was a homelike air about the tent at\\nsupper time, and, though a lunch camp in the middle of the night is\\nalways rather bleak, there was never anything slovenly. Another thing\\nwhich struck me even more forcibly was the cooking. We were of course on\\njust the same ration as the tent from which I had come. I was hungry and\\nsaid so. \\"Bad cooking,\\" said Wilson shortly; and so it was. For in two or\\nthree days the sharpest edge was off my hunger. Wilson and Scott had\\nlearned many a cooking tip in the past, and, instead of the same old meal\\nday by day, the weekly ration was so manoeuvred by a clever cook that\\nit was seldom quite the same meal. Sometimes pemmican plain, or thicker\\npemmican with some arrowroot mixed with it: at others we surrendered a\\nbiscuit and a half apiece and had a dry hoosh, i.e. biscuit fried in\\npemmican with a little water added, and a good big cup of cocoa to\\nfollow. Dry hooshes also saved oil. There were cocoa and tea upon which\\nto ring the changes, or better still \'teaco\' which combined the\\nstimulating qualities of tea with the food value of cocoa. Then much\\ncould be done with the dessert-spoonful of raisins which was our daily\\nwhack. They were good soaked in the tea, but best perhaps in with the\\nbiscuits and pemmican as a dry hoosh. \\"You are going far to earn my\\nundying gratitude, Cherry,\\" was a satisfied remark of Scott one evening\\nwhen, having saved, unbeknownst to my companions, some of their daily\\nration of cocoa, arrowroot, sugar and raisins, I made a \\"chocolate\\nhoosh.\\" But I am afraid he had indigestion next morning. There were meals\\nwhen we had interesting little talks, as when I find in my diary that:\\n\\"we had a jolly lunch meal, discussing authors. Barrie, Galsworthy and\\nothers are personal friends of Scott. Some one told Max Beerbohm that he\\nwas like Captain Scott, and immediately, so Scott assured us, he grew a\\nbeard.\\"\\nBut about three weeks out the topics of conversation became threadbare.\\nFrom then onwards it was often that whole days passed without\\nconversation beyond the routine Camp ho! All ready? Pack up. Spell ho.\\nThe latter after some two hours\' pulling. When man-hauling we used to\\nstart pulling immediately we had the tent down, the sledge packed and our\\nharness over our bodies and ski on our feet. After about a quarter of an\\nhour the effects of the marching would be felt in the warming of hands\\nand feet and the consequent thawing of our mitts and finnesko. We then\\nhalted long enough for everybody to adjust their ski and clothing: then\\non, perhaps for two hours or more, before we halted again.\\nSince it had been decided to lighten the ponies\' weights, we left at\\nleast 100 lbs. of pony forage behind when we started from One Ton on the\\nnight of November 16-17 on our first 13-mile march. This was a distinct\\nsaving, and instead of 695 lbs. each with which the six stronger ponies\\nleft Corner Camp, they now pulled only 625 lbs. Jehu had only 455 lbs.\\nand Chinaman 448 lbs. The dog-teams had 860 lbs. of pony food between\\nthem, and according to plan the two teams were to carry 1570 lbs. from\\nOne Ton between them. These weights included the sledges, with straps and\\nfittings, which weighed about 45 lbs.\\nSummer seemed long in coming for we marched into a considerable breeze\\nand the temperature was -18\xb0. Oates and Seaman Evans had quite a crop of\\nfrost-bites. I pointed out to Meares that his nose was gone; but he left\\nit, saying that he had got tired of it, and it would thaw out by and by.\\nThe ponies were going better for their rest. The next day\'s march was\\nover crusty snow with a layer of loose powdery snow at the top, and a\\ntemperature of -21\xb0 was chilly. Towards the end of it Scott got\\nfrightened that the ponies were not going as well as they should. Another\\ncouncil of war was held, and it was decided that an average of thirteen\\nmiles a day must be done at all costs, and that another sack of forage\\nshould be dumped here, putting the ponies on short rations later, if\\nnecessary. Oates agreed, but said the ponies were going better than he\\nexpected: that Jehu and Chinaman might go a week, and almost certainly\\nwould go three days. Bowers was always against this dumping. Meanwhile\\nScott wrote: \\"It\'s touch and go whether we scrape up to the glacier;\\nmeanwhile we get along somehow.\\"[201]\\n[Illustration: PARHELIA--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nAs a result of one of Christopher\'s tantrums Bowers records that his\\nsledge-meter was carried away this morning: \\"I took my sledge-meter into\\nthe tent after breakfast and rigged up a fancy lashing with raw hide\\nthongs so as to give it the necessary play with security. A splendid\\nparhelia exhibition was caused by the ice-crystals. Round the sun was a\\n22\xb0 halo [that is a halo 22\xb0 from the sun\'s image], with four mock suns\\nin rainbow colours, and outside this another halo in complete rainbow\\ncolours.

But poor Jehu was in a bad way,\\nstopping every few hundred yards. It was a funereal business for the\\nleaders of these crock ponies; and at this stage of the journey Atkinson,\\nWright and Keohane had many more difficulties than most of us, and the\\nsuccess of their ponies was largely due to their patience and care.\\nIncidentally big icicles formed upon the ponies\' noses during the march\\nand Chinaman used Wright\'s windproof blouse as a handkerchief. During the\\nlast of these marches, that is on the morning of November 21, we saw a\\nmassive cairn ahead, and found there the motor party, consisting of\\nLieutenant Evans, Day, Lashly and Hooper. The cairn was in 80\xb0 32\xb4, and\\nunder the name Mount Hooper formed our Upper Barrier Dep\xf4t. We left there\\nthree S (summit) rations, two cases of emergency biscuits and two cases\\nof oil, which constituted three weekly food units for the three parties\\nwhich were to advance from the bottom of the Beardmore Glacier. This food\\nwas to take them back from 80\xb0 32\xb4 to One Ton Camp. We all camped for the\\nnight 3 miles farther on: sixteen men, five tents, ten ponies,\\ntwenty-three dogs and thirteen sledges.\\nThe man-hauling party had been waiting for six days; and, having expected\\nus before, were getting anxious about us. They declared that they were\\nvery hungry, and Day, who was always long and thin, looked quite gaunt.\\nSome spare biscuits which we gave them from our tent were carried off\\nwith gratitude. The rest of us who were driving dogs or leading ponies\\nstill found our Barrier ration satisfying.\\nWe had now been out three weeks and had travelled 192 miles, and formed a\\nvery good idea as to what the ponies could do. The crocks had done\\nwonderfully:--\\"We hope Jehu will last three days; he will then be\\nfinished in any case and fed to the dogs. It is amusing to see Meares\\nlooking eagerly for the chance of a feed for his animals; he has been\\nexpecting it daily. On the other hand, Atkinson and Oates are eager to\\nget the poor animal beyond the point at which Shackleton killed his first\\nbeast. Reports on Chinaman are very favourable, and it really looks as\\nthough the ponies are going to do what is hoped of them.\\"[202] From first\\nto last Nobby, who was rescued from the floe, was the strongest pony we\\nhad, and was now drawing a heavier load than any other pony by 50 lbs. He\\nwas a well-shaped, contented kind of animal, misnamed a pony. Indeed\\nseveral of our beasts were too large to fit this description.\\nChristopher, of course, was wearing himself out quicker than most, but\\nall of them had lost a lot of weight in spite of the fact that they had\\nall the oats and oil-cake they could eat. Bowers writes of his pony:\\n\\"Victor, my pony, has taken to leading the line, like his opposite number\\nlast season. He is a steady goer, and as gentle as a dear old sheep. I\\ncan hardly realize the strenuous times I had with him only a month ago,\\nwhen it took about four of us to get him harnessed to a sledge, and two\\nof us every time with all our strength to keep him from bolting when in\\nit. Even at the start of the journey he was as nearly unmanageable as any\\nbeast could be, and always liable to bolt from sheer excess of spirits.\\nHe is more sober now after three weeks of featureless Barrier, but I\\nthink I am more fond of him than ever. He has lost his rotundity, like\\nall the other horses, and is a long-legged, angular beast, very ugly as\\nhorses go, but still I would not change him for any other.\\"\\nThe ponies were fed by their leaders at the lunch and supper halts, and\\nby Oates and Bowers during the sleep halt about four hours before we\\nmarched. Several of them developed a troublesome habit of swinging their\\nnosebags off, some as soon as they were put on, others in their anxiety\\nto reach the corn still left uneaten in the bottom of the bag. We had to\\nlash their bags on to their headstalls. \\"Victor got hold of his head rope\\nyesterday, and devoured it: not because he is hungry, as he won\'t eat all\\nhis allowance even now.\\"[203]\\nThe original intention was that Day and Hooper should return from 80\xb0\\n30\xb4, but it was now decided that their unit of four should remain intact\\nfor a few days, and constitute a light man-hauling advance party to make\\nthe track.\\nThe weather was much more pleasant and we saw the sun most days, while I\\nnote only one temperature below -20\xb0 since leaving One Ton. The ponies\\nsank in a cruel distance some days, but we were certainly not overworking\\nthem and they had as much food as they could eat. We knew the grim part\\nwas to come, but we never realized how grim it was to be. From this\\nNorthern Barrier Dep\xf4t the ponies were mostly drawing less than 500 lbs.\\nand we had hopes of getting through to the glacier without much\\ndifficulty. All depended on the weather, and just now it was glorious,\\nand the ponies were going steadily together. Jehu, the crockiest of the\\ncrocks, was led back along the track and shot on the evening of November\\n24, having reached a point at least 15 miles beyond that where Shackleton\\nshot his first pony. When it is considered that it was doubtful whether\\nhe could start at all this must be conceded to have been a triumph of\\nhorse-management in which both Oates and Atkinson shared, though neither\\nso much as Jehu himself, for he must have had a good spirit to have\\ndragged his poor body so far. \\"A year\'s care and good feeding, three\\nweeks\' work with good treatment, a reasonable load and a good ration, and\\nthen a painless end. If anybody can call that cruel I cannot either\\nunderstand it or agree with them.\\" Thus Bowers, who continues: \\"The\\nmidnight sun reflected from the snow has started to burn my face and\\nlips. I smear them with hazeline before turning in, and find it a good\\nthing. Wearing goggles has absolutely prevented any recurrence of\\nsnow-blindness. Captain Scott says they make me see everything through\\nrose-coloured spectacles.\\"\\nWe said good-bye to Day and Hooper next morning, and they set their faces\\nnorthwards and homewards.[204] Two-men parties on the Barrier are not\\nmuch fun. Day had certainly done his best about the motors and they had\\nhelped us over a bad bit of initial surface. That night Scott wrote:\\n\\"Only a few more marches to feel safe in getting to our goal.\\"[205] At\\nthe lunch halt on November 26, in lat. 81\xb0 35\xb4, we left our Middle\\nBarrier Dep\xf4t, containing one week\'s provisions for each returning unit\\nas at Mount Hooper, a reduction of 200 lbs. in our weights. The march\\nthat day was very trying. \\"It is always rather dismal work walking over\\nthe great snow plain when sky and surface merge in one pall of dead\\nwhiteness, but it is cheering to be in such good company with everything\\ngoing on steadily and well.\\"[206]\\nThere was no doubt that the animals were tiring, and \\"a tired animal\\nmakes a tired man, I find.\\"[207] The next day (November 28) was no\\nbetter: \\"the most dismal start imaginable. Thick as a hedge, snow falling\\nand drifting with keen southerly wind.\\"[208]\\nBowers notes: \\"We have now run down a whole degree of latitude without a\\nfine day, or anything but clouds, mist, and driving snow from the south.\\"\\nWe certainly did have some difficult marches, one of the worst effects of\\nwhich was that we knew we must be making a winding course and we had to\\npick up our dep\xf4ts on the return somehow. Here is a typical bad morning\\nfrom Bowers\' diary:\\n\\"The first four miles of the march were utter misery for me, as Victor,\\neither through lassitude or because he did not like having to plug into\\nthe wind, went as slow as a funeral horse. The light was so bad that\\nwearing goggles was most necessary, and the driving snow filled them up\\nas fast as you cleared them. I dropped a long way astern of the\\ncavalcade, could hardly see them at times through the snow, but the fear\\nthat Victor, of all the beasts, should give out was like a nightmare. I\\nhave always been used to starting later than the others by a quarter of a\\nmile, and catching them up. At the four-mile cairn I was about fed up to\\nthe neck with it, but I said very little as everybody was so disgusted\\nwith the weather and things in general that I saw that I was not the only\\none in tribulation. Victor turned up trumps after that. He stepped out\\nand led the line in his old place, and at a good swinging pace\\nconsidering the surface, my temper and spirits improving at every step.\\nIn the afternoon he went splendidly again, and finished up by rolling in\\nthe snow when I had taken his harness off, a thing he has not done for\\nten or twelve days. It certainly does not look like exhaustion!\\"\\nIndeed these days we were fighting for our marches, and Chinaman who was\\nkilled this night seemed well out of it. He reached a point less than 90\\nmiles from the glacier, though this was small comfort to him.\\nStumbling and groping our way along as we had been during the last\\nblizzard we were totally unprepared for the sight which met us during our\\nnext march on November 29. The great ramp of mountains which ran to the\\nwest of us, and would soon bar our way to the South, partly cleared: and\\nright on top of us it seemed were the triple peaks of Mount Markham.\\nAfter some 300 miles of bleak, monotonous Barrier it was a wonderful\\nsight indeed. We camped at night in latitude 82\xb0 21\xb4 S., four miles\\nbeyond Scott\'s previous Farthest South in 1902. Then they had the best of\\nluck in clear fine weather, which Shackleton has also recorded at this\\nstage of his southern journey.","image":null},{"merge":"C10.06","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The expedition skirting mountains toward the southern pole reports the mental strain and the positive effects of good weather.

The crystal surface which was an invisible carpet\\nyesterday becomes a shining glorious sheet of many colours to-day: the\\nirregularities which caused you so many falls are now quite clear and you\\nstep on or over them without a thought: and when there is added some of\\nthe most wonderful scenery in the world it is hard to recall in the\\nenjoyment of the present how irritable and weary you felt only twenty\\nhours ago. The whisper of the sledge, the hiss of the primus, the smell\\nof the hoosh and the soft folds of your sleeping-bag: how jolly they can\\nall be, and generally were.\\n    I would that I could once again\\n      Around the cooker sit\\n    And hearken to its soft refrain\\n      And feel so jolly fit.\\n    Instead of home-life\'s silken chains,\\n      The uneventful round,\\n    I long to be mid snow-swept plains,\\n      In harness, outward bound.\\n    With the pad, pad, pad, of fin\'skoed feet,\\n      With two hundred pounds per man,\\n    Not enough hoosh or biscuit to eat,\\n      Well done, lads! Up tent! Outspan.\\n                (NELSON in _The South Polar Times._)\\nCertainly as we skirted these mountains, range upon range, during the\\nnext two marches (November 30 and December 1), we felt we could have\\nlittle cause for complaint. They brought us to lat. 82\xb0 47\xb4 S., and here\\nwe left our last dep\xf4t on the Barrier, called the Southern Barrier Dep\xf4t,\\nwith a week\'s ration for each returning party as usual. \\"The man food is\\nenough for one week for each returning unit of four men, the next dep\xf4t\\nbeyond being the Middle Barrier Dep\xf4t, 73 miles north. As we ought easily\\nto do over 100 miles a week on the return journey, there is little\\nlikelihood of our having to go on short commons if all goes well.\\"[209]\\nAnd this was what we all felt--until we found the Polar Party. This was\\nour twenty-seventh camp, and we had been out a month.\\n[Illustration: THE MOUNTAINS WHICH LIE BETWEEN THE BARRIER AND THE\\nPLATEAU AS SEEN ON DECEMBER 1, 1911--From the drawings by Dr. E. A.\\nWilson, Emery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\nIt was important that we should have fine clear weather during the next\\nfew days when we should be approaching the land. On his previous southern\\njourney Scott had been prevented from reaching the range of mountains\\nwhich ran along to our right by a huge chasm. This phenomenon is known to\\ngeologists as a shear crack and is formed by the movement of a glacier\\naway from the land which bounds it. In this case a mass of many hundred\\nmiles of Barrier has moved away from the mountains, and the disturbance\\nis correspondingly great. Shackleton has described how he approached the\\nGateway, as he named the passage between Mount Hope and the mainland, by\\nmeans of which he passed through on to the Beardmore Glacier. As he and\\nhis companions were exploring the way they came upon an enormous chasm,\\n80 feet wide and 300 feet deep, which barred their path. Moving along to\\nthe right they found a place where the chasm was filled with snow, and\\nhere they crossed to the land some miles ahead. At our Southern Barrier\\nDep\xf4t we reckoned we were some forty-four miles from this Gateway and in\\nthree more marches we hoped to be camped under this land.\\nChristopher was shot at the dep\xf4t. He was the only pony who did not die\\ninstantaneously. Perhaps Oates was not so calm as usual, for Chris was\\nhis own horse though such a brute. Just as Oates fired he moved, and\\ncharged into the camp with the bullet in his head. He was caught with\\ndifficulty, nearly giving Keohane a bad bite, led back and finished. We\\nwere well rid of him: while he was strong he fought, and once the Barrier\\nhad tamed him, as we were not able to do, he never pulled a fair load. He\\ncould have gone several more days, but there was not enough pony food to\\ntake all the animals forward. We began to wonder if we had done right to\\nleave so much behind. Each pony provided at least four days\' food for the\\ndog-teams, some of them more, and there was quite a lot of fat on\\nthem--even on Jehu. This was comforting, as going to prove that their\\nhardships were not too great. Also we put the undercut into our own\\nhoosh, and it was very good, though we had little oil to cook it.\\nWe had been starting later each night, in order that the transition from\\nnight to day marching might be gradual. For we intended to march by day\\nwhen we started pulling up the glacier, and there were no ponies to rest\\nwhen the sun was high. It may be said therefore that our next march was\\non December 2.\\nBefore we started Scott walked over to Bowers. \\"I have come to a decision\\nwhich will shock you.\\" Victor was to go at the end of the march, because\\npony food was running so short. Birdie wrote at the end of the day:--He\\n\\"did a splendid march and kept ahead all day, and as usual marched into\\ncamp first, pulling over 450 lbs. easily. It seemed an awful pity to have\\nto shoot a great strong animal, and it seemed like the irony of fate to\\nme, as I had been downed for over-provisioning the ponies with needless\\nexcess of food, and the drastic reductions had been made against my\\nstrenuous opposition up to the last. It is poor satisfaction to me to\\nknow that I was right now that my horse is dead. Good old Victor! He has\\nalways had a biscuit out of my ration, and he ate his last before the\\nbullet sent him to his rest. Here ends my second horse in 83\xb0 S., not\\nquite so tragically as my first when the sea-ice broke up, but none the\\nless I feel sorry for a beast that has been my constant companion and\\ncare for so long. He has done his share in our undertaking anyhow, and\\nmay I do my share as well when I get into harness myself.\\n\\"The snow has started to fall over his bleak resting-place, and it looks\\nlike a blizzard. The outlook is dark, stormy and threatening.\\"\\nIndeed it had been a dismal march into a blank white wall, and the ponies\\nwere sinking badly in the snow, leaving holes a full foot deep. The\\ntemperature was +17\xb0 and the flakes of snow melted when they lay on the\\ndark colours of the tents and our furs. After building the pony walls\\nwater was running down our windproofs.\\nI note \\"we are doing well on pony meat and go to bed very content.\\"\\nNotwithstanding the fact that we could not do more than heat the meat by\\nthrowing it into the pemmican we found it sweet and good, though tough.\\nThe man-hauling party consisted of Lieut. Evans and Lashly who had lost\\ntheir motors, and Atkinson and Wright who had lost their ponies. They\\nwere really quite hungry by now, and most of us pretty well looked\\nforward to our meals and kept a biscuit to eat in our bags if we could.\\nThe pony meat therefore came as a relief. I think we ought to have\\ndep\xf4ted more of it on the cairns. As it was, what we did not eat was\\ngiven to the dogs. With some tins of extra oil and a dep\xf4ted pony the\\nPolar Party would probably have got home in safety.\\nOn December 3 we roused out at 2.30 A.M. It was thick and snowy. As we\\nbreakfasted the blizzard started from the south-east, and was soon\\nblowing force 9, a full gale, with heavy drift. \\"The strongest wind I\\nhave known here in summer.\\"[210] It was impossible to start, but we\\nturned out and made up the pony walls in heavy drift, one of them being\\nblown down three times. By 1.30 P.M. the sun was shining, and the land\\nwas clear. We started at 2, with what we thought was Mount Hope showing\\nup ahead, but soon great snow-clouds were banking up and in two hours we\\nwere walking in a deep gloom which made it difficult to find the track\\nmade by the man-hauling party ahead. By the time we reached the cairn,\\nwhich was always built at the end of the first four miles, it was blowing\\nhard from the N.N.W. of all the unlikely quarters of the compass. Bowers\\nand Scott were on ski.\\n\\"I put on my windproof blouse and nosed out the track for two miles, when\\nwe suddenly came upon the tent of the leading party. They had camped\\nowing to the difficulty of steering a course in such thick weather. The\\nponies, however, with the wind abaft the beam were going along\\nsplendidly, and Scott thought it worth while to shove on. We therefore\\ncarried on another four miles, making ten in all, a good half march,\\nbefore we camped. On ski it was simply ripping, except for the inability\\nto see anything at all. With the wind behind, and the good sliding\\nsurface made by the wind-hardened snow, one fairly slithered along.\\nCamping was less pleasant as it was blowing a gale by that time. We are\\nall in our bags again now, with a good hot meal inside one, and blow high\\nor blow low one might be in a worse place than a reindeer bag.\\"[211]","image":null},{"merge":"C10.07","output":"{\'summary\': \'The team struggles with deep snow and extreme weather conditions, which causes travel delays and hardships for the ponies.

This day we began to cross the great\\nundulations in the Barrier, with the crests some mile apart, which here\\nmark the approach to the land. We had built the walls to the north of the\\nponies on camping, because the wind was from that direction, but by\\nbreakfast on December 4 it was blowing a thick blizzard from the\\nsouth-east. We began to feel bewildered by these extraordinary weather\\nchanges, and not a little exasperated too. Again we could not march, and\\nagain we had to dig out the sledges and ponies, and to move them all\\nround to the other side of the walls which we had partly to rebuild. \\"Oh\\nfor the simple man-hauling life!\\" was our thought, and \\"poor helpless\\nbeasts--this is no country for live stock.\\" By this time we could not see\\nthe neighbouring tents for the drift. The situation was not improved by\\nthe fact that our tent doors, the tents having been pitched for the\\nstrong north wind then blowing, were now facing the blizzard, and sheets\\nof snow entered with each individual. The man-hauling party came up just\\nbefore the worst of the blizzard started. The dogs alone were\\ncomfortable, buried deep beneath the drifted snow. The sailors began to\\ndebate who was the Jonah. They said he was the cameras. The great\\nblizzard was brewing all about us.\\nBut at mid-day as though a curtain was rolled back, the thick snow fog\\ncleared off, while at the same time the wind fell calm, and a great\\nmountain appeared almost on the top of us. Far away to the south-east we\\ncould distinguish, by looking very carefully, a break in the level\\nBarrier horizon--a new mountain which we reckoned must be at least in\\nlatitude 86\xb0 and very high. Towards it the ranges stretched away, peak\\nupon peak, range upon range, as far as the eye could see. \\"The mountains\\nsurpassed anything I have ever seen: beside the least of these giants Ben\\nNevis would be a mere mound, and yet they are so immense as to dwarf each\\nother. They are intersected at every turn with mighty glaciers and\\nice-falls and eternally ice-filled valleys that defy description. So\\nclear was everything that every rock seemed to stand out, and the effect\\nof the sun as he came round (between us and the mountains) was to make\\nthe scene still more beautiful.\\"[212]\\nAltogether we marched eleven miles this day, and camped right in front of\\nthe Gateway, which we reckoned to be some thirteen miles away. We saw no\\ncrevasses but crossed ten or twelve very large undulations, and estimated\\nthat the dips between them were twelve to fifteen feet. Mount Hope was\\nbigger than we expected, and beyond it, stretching out into the Barrier\\nas far as we could see, was a great white line of jagged edges, the chaos\\nof pressure which this vast glacier makes as it flows into the\\ncomparatively stationary ice of the Barrier.\\nMy own pony Michael was shot after we came into camp. He was as\\nattractive a little beast as we had. His light weight helped him on soft\\nsurfaces, but his small hoofs let him in farther than most and I notice\\nin Scott\'s diary that on November 19 the ponies were sinking half-way to\\nthe hock, and Michael once or twice almost to the hock itself. A highly\\nstrung, spirited animal, his off days took the form of fidgets, during\\nwhich he would be constantly trying to stop and eat snow, and then rush\\nforward to catch up the other ponies. Life was a constant source of\\nwonder to him, and no movement in the camp escaped his notice. Before we\\nhad been long on the Barrier he developed mischievous habits and became a\\nrope eater and gnawer of other ponies\' fringes, as we called the coloured\\ntassels we hung over their eyes to ward off snow-blindness. However, he\\nwas by no means the only culprit, and he lost his own fringe to Nobby\\nquite early in the proceedings. It was not that he was hungry, for he\\nnever quite finished his own feed. At any rate he enjoyed the few weeks\\nbefore he died, pricking up his ears and getting quite excited when\\nanything happened, and the arrival of the dog-teams each morning after he\\nhad been tethered sent him to bed with much to dream of. And I must say\\nhis master dreamed pretty regularly too. Michael was killed right in\\nfront of the Gateway on December 4, just before the big blizzard, which,\\nthough we did not know it, was on the point of breaking upon us, and he\\nwas untying his cloth and chewing up everything he could reach to the\\nlast. \\"It was decided after we camped, and he had his feed already on:\\nMeares reported that he had no more food for the dogs. He walked away,\\nand rolled in the snow on the way down, not having done so when we got\\nin. He was just like a naughty child all the way, and pulled all out. He\\nhas been a good friend, and has a good record, 82\xb0 23\xb4 S. He was a bit\\ndone to-day: the blizzard had knocked him. Gallant little Michael!\\"[213]\\nAs we got into our bags the mountain tops were fuzzy with drift. We\\nwanted one clear day to get across the chasm: one short march and the\\nponies\' task was done. Their food was nearly finished. Scott wrote that\\nnight: \\"We are practically through with the first stage of our\\njourney.\\"[214]\\n\\"Tuesday, December 5. Camp 30. Noon. We awoke this morning to a raging\\nhowling blizzard. The blows we have had hitherto have lacked the very\\nfine powdering snow, that especial feature of the blizzard. To-day we\\nhave it fully developed. After a minute or two in the open one is covered\\nfrom head to foot. The temperature is high, so that what falls or drives\\nagainst one sticks. The ponies--heads, tails, legs and all parts not\\nprotected by their rugs--are covered with ice; the animals are standing\\ndeep in snow, the sledges are almost covered, and huge drifts above the\\ntents. We have had breakfast, rebuilt the walls, and are now again in our\\nbags. One cannot see the next tent, let alone the land. What on earth\\ndoes such weather mean at this time of year? It is more than our share of\\nill-fortune, I think, but the luck may turn yet....\\n\\"11 P.M. It has blown hard all day with quite the greatest snowfall I\\nremember. The drifts about the tents are simply huge. The temperature was\\n-27\xb0 this forenoon, and rose to +31\xb0 in the afternoon, at which time the\\nsnow melted as it fell on anything but the snow, and, as a consequence,\\nthere are pools of water on everything, the tents are wet through, also\\nthe wind-clothes, night-boots, etc.; water drips from the tent poles and\\ndoor, lies on the floor-cloth, soaks the sleeping-bags, and makes\\neverything pretty wretched. If a cold snap follows before we have had\\ntime to dry our things, we shall be mighty uncomfortable. Yet after all\\nit would be humorous enough if it were not for the seriousness of\\ndelay--we can\'t afford that, and it\'s real hard luck that it should come\\nat such a time. The wind shows signs of easing down, but the temperature\\ndoes not fall and the snow is as wet as ever, not promising signs of\\nabatement.\\n\\"Wednesday, December 6. Camp 30. Noon. Miserable, utterly miserable. We\\nhave camped in the \'Slough of Despond.\' The tempest rages with unabated\\nviolence. The temperature has gone to +33\xb0; everything in the tent is\\nsoaking. People returning from the outside look exactly as though they\\nhad been in a heavy shower of rain. They drip pools on the floor-cloth.\\nThe snow is steadily climbing higher about walls, ponies, tents and\\nsledges. The ponies look utterly desolate. Oh! But this is too crushing,\\nand we are only 12 miles from the glacier. A hopeless feeling descends on\\none and is hard to fight off. What immense patience is needed for such\\noccasions!\\"[215]\\nBowers describes the situation as follows:\\n\\"It is blowing a blizzard such as one might expect to be driven at us by\\nall the powers of darkness.

The temperature was\\n+35.5\xb0, and our bags were like sponges. The huge drifts had covered\\neverything, including most of the tent, the pony walls and sledges. At\\nintervals we dug our way out and dug up the wretched ponies, and got them\\non to the top again. \\"Henceforward our full ration will be 16 oz.\\nbiscuit, 12 oz. pemmican, 2 oz. butter, 0.57 oz. cocoa, 3.0 oz. sugar and\\n0.86 oz. tea. This is the Summit ration, total 34.43 oz., with a little\\nonion powder and salt. I am all for this: Seaman Evans and others are\\nmuch regretting the loss of chocolate, raisins and cereals. For the first\\nweek up the glacier we are to go one biscuit short to provision Meares on\\nthe way back. The motors dep\xf4ted too much and Meares has been brought on\\nfar farther than his orders were originally bringing him. Originally he\\nwas to be back at Hut Point on December 10. The dogs, however, are\\ngetting all the horse that is good for them, and are very fit. He has to\\naverage 24 miles a day going back. Michael is well out of this: we are\\nnow eating him. He was in excellent condition and tastes very good,\\nthough tough.\\"[218]\\nBy this time there was little sleep left for us as we lay in our\\nsleeping-bags. Three days generally see these blizzards out, and we hoped\\nmuch from Friday, December 8. But when we breakfasted at 10 A.M. (we were\\ngetting into day-marching routine) wind and snow were monotonously the\\nsame. The temperature rose to +34.3\xb0. These temperatures and those\\nrecorded by Meares on his way home must be a record for the interior of\\nthe Barrier. So far as we were concerned it did not much matter now\\nwhether it was +40\xb0 or +34\xb0. Things did look really gloomy that morning.\\nBut at noon there came a gleam of comfort. The wind dropped, and\\nimmediately we were out plunging about, always up to our knees in soft\\ndowny snow, and often much farther. First we shifted our tents, digging\\nthem up with the greatest care that the shovel might not tear them. The\\nvalances were encased in solid ice from the water which had run down.\\nThen we started to find our sledges which were about four feet down: they\\nwere dragged out, and everything on them was wringing wet. There was a\\ngleam of sunshine, which soon gave place to snow and gloom, but we\\nstarted to make experiments in haulage. Four men on ski managed to move a\\nsledge with four others sitting upon it. Nobby was led out, but sank to\\nhis belly. As for the drifts I saw Oates standing behind one, and only\\nhis head appeared, and this was all loose snow.\\n\\"We are all sitting round now after some tea--it is much better than\\ngetting into the bags. I can hardly think that the ponies can pull on,\\nbut Titus thinks they can pull to-morrow; all the food is finished, and\\nwhat they have had to-day was only what they would not eat out of their\\nlast feed yesterday. It is a terrible end--driven to death on no more\\nfood, to be then cut up, poor devils. I have swopped the Little Minister\\nwith Silas Wright for Dante\'s Inferno!\\"[219] The steady patter of the\\nfalling snow upon the tents was depressing as we turned in, but the\\ntemperature was below freezing.\\nThe next morning (Saturday, December 9) we turned out to a cloudy snowy\\nday at 5.30 A.M. By 8.30 we had hauled the sledges some way out of the\\ncamp and started to lead out the ponies. \\"The horses could hardly move,\\nsank up to their bellies, and finally lay down. They had to be driven,\\nlashed on. It was a grim business.\\"[220]\\nMy impressions of that day are of groping our way, for Bowers and I were\\npulling a light sledge ahead to make the track, through a vague white\\nwall. First a confused crowd of men behind us gathered round the leading\\npony sledge, pushing it forward, the poor beast barely able to struggle\\nout of the holes it made as it plunged forward. The others were induced\\nto follow, and after a start had been made the regular man-hauling party\\nwent back to fetch their load. There was not one man there who would\\nwillingly have caused pain to a living thing. But what else was to be\\ndone--we could not leave our pony dep\xf4t in that bog. Hour after hour we\\nplugged on: and we dare not halt for lunch, we knew we could never start\\nagain. After crossing many waves huge pressure ridges suddenly showed\\nthemselves all round, and we got on to a steep rise with the coastal\\nchasm on our right hand appearing as a great dip full of enormous\\npressure. Scott was naturally worried about crevasses, and though we knew\\nthere was a way through, the finding of it in the gloom was most\\ndifficult. For two hours we zig-zagged about, getting forward it is true,\\nbut much bewildered, and once at any rate almost bogged. Scott joined us,\\nand we took off our ski so as to find the crevasses, and if possible a\\nhard way through. Every step we sank about fifteen inches, and often\\nabove our knees. Meanwhile Snatcher was saving the situation in\\nsnow-shoes, and led the line of ponies. Snippets nearly fell back into a\\nbig crevasse, into which his hind quarters fell: but they managed to\\nunharness him, and scramble him out.\\nI do not know how long we had been going when Scott decided to follow the\\nchasm. We found a big dip with hard ice underneath, and it was probably\\nhere that we made the crossing: we could now see the ring of pressure\\nbehind us. Almost it was decided to make the dep\xf4t here, but the ponies\\nstill plugged on in the most plucky way, though they had to be driven.\\nScott settled to go as far as they could be induced to march, and they\\ndid wonderfully. We had never thought that they would go a mile: but\\npainfully they marched for eleven hours without a long halt, and covered\\na distance which we then estimated at seven miles. But our sledge-meters\\nwere useless being clogged with the soft snow, and we afterwards came to\\nbelieve the distance was not so great: probably not more than five.

THE BEARDMORE GLACIER\\n\\nThe ponies had dragged twenty-four weekly units of food for four men to\\nsome five miles from the bottom of the glacier, but we were late. For\\nsome days we had been eating the Summit ration, that is the food which\\nshould not have been touched until the Glacier Dep\xf4t had been laid, and\\nwe were still a day\'s run from the place where this was to be done: it\\nwas of course the result of the blizzard which no one could have expected\\nin December, usually one of the two most settled months. Still more\\nserious was the deep snow which lay like down upon the surface, and into\\nwhich we sank commonly to our knees, our sledges digging themselves in\\nuntil the crosspieces were ploughing through the drift. Shackleton had\\nfine weather, and found blue ice in the bottom reaches of the glacier,\\nand Scott lamented what was unquestionably bad luck.\\nIt was noon of December 10 before we had made the readjustments necessary\\nfor man-hauling. We left here pony meat for man and dog food, three\\nten-foot sledges, one twelve-foot sledge, and a good many oddments of\\nclothing and pony gear. We started with three four-man teams, each\\npulling for these first few miles about 500 lbs., as follows: (I) Scott,\\nWilson, Oates, Seaman Evans: (II) Lieut. Evans, Atkinson, Wright, Lashly:\\n(III) Bowers, Cherry-Garrard, Crean, Keohane. The team numbered (II) had\\nbeen man-hauling together some days, and two members of it, Lieut. Evans\\nand Lashly, had already been man-hauling since the breakdown of the\\nsecond motor at Corner Camp; it was certainly not so fit as the other\\ntwo. In addition to these three sledges the two dog-teams, which had been\\ndoing splendid work, were carrying 600 lbs. of our weight as well as the\\nprovisions for the Lower Glacier Dep\xf4t, weighing 200 lbs. It began to\\nlook as if Amundsen had chosen the right form of transport.\\nThe Gateway is a gap in the mountains, a side door, as it were, to the\\ngreat tumbled glacier. By lunch we were on the top of the divide, but it\\ntook six hours of the hardest hauling to cover the mile which formed the\\nrise. As long as possible we stuck to ski, but we reached a point at\\nwhich we could not move the sledges on ski: once we had taken them off we\\nwere up to our knees, and the sledges were ploughing the snow which would\\nnot support them. But our gear was drying in the bright sunshine, our\\nbags were spread out at every opportunity, and the great jagged cliffs of\\nred granite were welcome to the eyes after 425 statute miles of snow. The\\nGateway is filled by a giant snowdrift which has been formed between\\nMount Hope on our left and the mainland on our right. From Shackleton\'s\\nbook we gathered that the Beardmore was a very bad glacier indeed. Once\\non the top of the divide we lunched, and we descended in the evening,\\ncamping at midnight on the edge of the glacier, which we found, as we had\\nfeared, covered with soft snow which was so deep as to give no indication\\nwhatever of the hard ice which Shackleton found here. \\"We camped in\\nconsiderable drift and a blizzard wind, which is still blowing, and I\\nhope will go on, for every hour it is sweeping away inches of this soft\\npowdery snow into which we have been sinking all day.\\"[221]\\nBefore setting out on December 11 we rigged up the Lower Glacier Dep\xf4t,\\nthree weekly Summit units of provisions, two cases of emergency biscuit\\nwhich was the ration for three weekly units, and two cans of oil. These\\nprovisions were calculated to carry the three returning parties as far as\\nthe Southern Barrier Dep\xf4t. We also left one can of spirit, used for\\nlighting the primus, one bottle of medical brandy and certain spare and\\npersonal gear not required. On the sledges themselves we stowed eighteen\\nweekly Summit units, besides the three ready bags containing the ration\\nfor the current week, and the complement of biscuit, for this was ten\\ncases in addition to the three boxes of biscuit which the three parties\\nwere using. Then there were eighteen cans of oil, with two cans of\\nlighting spirit and a little additional Christmas fare which Bowers had\\npacked. Every unit of food was worked out for four men for one week.\\n[Illustration: TRANSIT SKETCH FOR THE LOWER GLACIER DEP\xd4T.--E. A. Wilson,\\ndel. Emery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\nDuring this time of deep snow the sledge-meters would not work and we\\nwere compelled to estimate the distance marched each day. \\"It has been a\\ntremendous slog, but I think a most hopeful day. Before starting it took\\nus about two hours to make the dep\xf4t and then we got straight into the\\nmidst of the big pressure. The dogs, with ten cases of biscuit, came\\nbehind and pulled very well. We soon caught sight of a big boulder, and\\nBill and I roped up and went over to it. It was a block of very coarse\\ngranite, nearly gneiss, with large crystals of quartz in it, rusty\\noutside and quite pinkish when chipped, and with veins of quartz running\\nthrough it. It was a vast thing to be carried along on the ice, and\\nlooked very typical of the rock round. Instead of keeping under the great\\ncliff where Shackleton made his dep\xf4t, we steered for Mount Kyffin, that\\nis towards the middle of the glacier, until lunch, when we had probably\\ndone about two or three miles. There was a crevasse wherever we went, but\\nwe managed to pull on ski and had no one down, and the deep snow saved\\nthe dogs.\\"[222] The dog-teams were certainly running very big risks that\\nmorning. They turned back after lunch, having been brought on far\\nlonger than had been originally intended, for, as I have said, they were\\nto have been back at Hut Point before now, and their provision allowance\\nwould not allow of further advance. Perhaps we rather overestimated the\\ndogs\' capacities when Bowers wrote: \\"The dogs are wonderfully fit and\\nwill rush Meares and Dimitri back like the wind. I expect he will be\\nnearly back by Christmas, as they will do about thirty miles a day.\\" But\\nMeares told us when we got back to the hut that the dogs had by no means\\nhad an easy journey home. Now, however, \\"with a whirl and a rush they\\nwere off on the homeward trail. I could not see them (being snow-blind),\\nbut heard the familiar orders as the last of our animal transport left\\nus.\\"[223]","image":null},{"merge":"C11.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The team faces many difficulties on their journey, including snow blindness, sinking sleds, and competition between teams.

The evening we reached the glacier Bowers\\nwrote: \\"I am afraid I am going to pay dearly for not wearing goggles\\nyesterday when piloting the ponies. My right eye has gone bung, and my\\nleft one is pretty dicky. If I am in for a dose of snow glare it will\\ntake three or four days to leave me, and I am afraid I am in the ditch\\nthis time. It is painful to look at this paper, and my eyes are fairly\\nburning as if some one had thrown sand into them.\\" And then: \\"I have\\nmissed my journal for four days, having been enduring the pains of hell\\nwith my eyes as well as doing the most back-breaking work I have ever\\ncome up against.... I was as blind as a bat, and so was Keohane in my\\nteam. Cherry pulled alongside me, with Crean and Keohane behind. By\\nsticking plaster over my glasses except one small central spot I shut off\\nmost light and could see the points of my ski, but the glasses were\\nalways fogged with perspiration and my eyes kept on streaming water which\\ncannot be wiped off on the march as a ski stick is held in each hand; and\\nso heavy were our weights [we had now taken on the weights which had been\\non the dog sledges] that if any of the pair slacked a hand even, the\\nsledge stopped. It was all we could do to keep the sledge moving for\\nshort spells of a few hundred yards, the whole concern sinking so deeply\\ninto the soft snow as to form a snow-plough. The starting was worse than\\npulling as it required from ten to fifteen desperate jerks on the harness\\nto move the sledge at all.\\" Many others were also snowblind, caused\\npartly by the strain of the last march of the ponies, partly by not\\nhaving realized that now that we were day-marching the sun was more\\npowerful and more precautions should be taken. The cocaine and zinc\\nsulphate tablets which we had were excellent, but we also found that our\\ntea leaves, which had been boiled twice and would otherwise have been\\nthrown away, relieved the pain if tied into some cotton and kept pressed\\nagainst the eyes. The tannic acid in the tea acted as an astringent. A\\nsnowblind man can see practically nothing anyhow and so he is not much\\nworse off if a handkerchief is tied over his eyes.\\n\\"_Beardmore Glacier._ Just a tiny note to be taken back by the dogs.\\nThings are not so rosy as they might be, but we keep our spirits up and\\nsay the luck must turn. This is only to tell you that I find I can keep\\nup with the rest as well as of old.\\"[224]\\n[Illustration: MOUNT F. L. SMITH AND THE LAND TO THE NORTH-WEST--E. A.\\nWilson, del. Emery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\nThen for the first time we were left with our full loads of 800 lbs. a\\nsledge. Even Bowers asked Scott whether he was going to try it without\\nrelaying. That night Scott\'s diary runs:\\n\\"It was a very anxious business when we started after lunch, about 4.30.\\nCould we pull our full loads or not? My own party got away first, and, to\\nmy joy, I found we could make fairly good headway. Every now and again\\nthe sledge sank in a soft patch, which brought us up, but we learned to\\ntreat such occasions with patience. We got sideways to the sledge and\\nhauled it out, Evans (P.O.) getting out of his ski to get better\\npurchase. The great thing is to keep the sledge moving, and for an hour\\nor more there were dozens of critical moments when it all but stopped,\\nand not a few when it brought up altogether. The latter were very trying\\nand tiring.\\"[225] Altogether it was an encouraging day and we reckoned we\\nhad made seven miles. Generally it was not Scott\'s team which made the\\nheaviest weather these days but on December 12 they were in greater\\ndifficulties than any of us. It was indeed a gruelling day, for the\\nsurface was worse than ever and many men were snow-blind. After five\\nhours\' work in the morning we were about half a mile forward. We were in\\na sea of pressure, the waves coming at us from our starboard bow, the\\ndistance between the crests not being very great. We could not have\\nadvanced at all had it not been for our ski: \\"on foot one sinks to the\\nknees, and if pulling on a sledge to half way between knee and\\nthigh.\\"[226]\\nOn December 13, \\"the sledges sank in over twelve inches, and all the\\ngear, as well as the thwartship pieces, were acting as breaks. The tugs\\nand heaves we enjoyed, and the number of times we had to get out of our\\nski to upright the sledge, were trifles compared with the strenuous\\nexertion of every muscle and nerve to keep the wretched drag from\\nstopping when once under weigh; and then it would stick, and all the\\nstarting operations had to be gone through afresh. We did perhaps half a\\nmile in the forenoon. Anticipating a better surface in the afternoon we\\ngot a shock. Teddy [Evans] led off half an hour earlier to pilot a way,\\nand Captain Scott tried some fake with his spare runners [he lashed them\\nunder the sledge to prevent the cross-pieces ploughing the snow] that\\ninvolved about an hour\'s work. We had to continually turn our runners up\\nto scrape the ice off them, for in these temperatures they are liable to\\nget warm and melt the snow on them, and that freezes into knobs of ice\\nwhich act like sandpaper or spikes on a pair of skates. We bust off\\nsecond full of hope having done so well in the forenoon, but pride goeth\\n[before a fall]. We stuck ten yards from the camp, and nine hours later\\nfound us little more than half a mile on. I have never seen a sledge sink\\nso. I have never pulled so hard, or so nearly crushed my inside into my\\nbackbone by the everlasting jerking with all my strength on the canvas\\nband round my unfortunate tummy. We were all in the same boat however.\\n\\"I saw Teddy struggling ahead and Scott astern, but we were the worst off\\nas the leading team had topped the rise and I was too blind to pick out a\\nbetter trail. We fairly played ourselves out that time, and finally had\\nto give it up and relay. Halving the load we went forward about a mile\\nwith it, and, leaving that lot, went back for the remainder. So done were\\nmy team that we could do little more than pull the half loads. Teddy\'s\\nteam did the same, and though Scott\'s did not, we camped practically the\\nsame time, having gone over our distance three times. Mount Kyffin was\\nstill ahead of us to the left: we seemed as if we can never come up with\\nit. To-morrow Scott decided that if we could not move our full loads we\\nwould start relaying systematically. It was a most depressing outlook\\nafter such a day of strenuous labour.\\"[227] We got soaked with\\nperspiration these days, though generally pulling in vest, pants, and\\nwindproof trousers only. Directly we stopped we cooled quickly. Two skuas\\nappeared at lunch, attracted probably by the pony flesh below, but it was\\na long way from the sea for them to come. On Thursday December 14, Scott\\nwrote: \\"Indigestion and the soggy condition of my clothes kept me awake\\nfor some time last night, and the exceptional exercise gives bad attacks\\nof cramp. Our lips are getting raw and blistered. The eyes of the party\\nare improving, I am glad to say. We are just starting our march with no\\nvery hopeful outlook.\\"\\n[Illustration: MOUNT ELIZABETH, MOUNT ANNE AND SOCKS GLACIER--E. A.\\nWilson, del. Emery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\nBut we slogged along with much better results. \\"Once into the middle of\\nthe glacier we had been steering more or less for the Cloudmaker and by\\nsupper to-day were well past Mount Kyffin and were about 2000 feet up\\nafter an estimated run of 11 or 12 statute miles. But the most cheering\\nsign was that the blue ice was gradually coming nearer the surface; at\\nlunch it was two feet down, and at our supper camp only one foot. In\\npitching our tent Crean broke into a crevasse which ran about a foot in\\nfront of the door and there was another at Scott\'s door. We threw an\\nempty oil can down and it echoed for a terribly long time.\\"[228] We\\nspent the morning of December 15 crossing a maze of crevasses though they\\nwere well bridged; I believe all these lower reaches of the glacier are\\nbadly crevassed, but the thick snow and our ski kept us from tumbling in.\\nThere was a great deal of competition between the teams which was perhaps\\nunavoidable but probably a pity. This day Bowers\' diary records, \\"Did a\\nsplendid bust off on ski, leaving Scott in the lurch, and eventually\\noverhauling the party which had left some time before us. All the morning\\nwe kept up a steady, even swing which was quite a pleasure.\\" But the same\\nday Scott wrote, \\"Evans\' is now decidedly the slowest unit, though\\nBowers\' is not much faster. We keep up and overhaul either without\\ndifficulty.\\" Bowers\' team considered themselves quite good, but both\\nteams were satisfied of their own superiority; as a matter of fact\\nScott\'s was the faster, as it should have been for it was certainly the\\nheavier of the two.\\n\\"It was a very bad light all day, but after lunch it began to get worse,\\nand by 5 o\'clock it was snowing hard and we could see nothing. We went on\\nfor nearly an hour, steering by the wind and any glimpse of sastrugi, and\\nthen, very reluctantly, Scott camped. It looks better now. The surface is\\nmuch harder and more wind-swept, and as a rule the ice is only six inches\\nunderneath. We are beginning to talk about Christmas. We get very thirsty\\nthese days in the warm temperatures: we shall feel it farther up when the\\ncold gets into our open pores and sunburnt hands and cracked lips. I am\\nplastering some skin on mine to-night. Our routine now is: turn out 5.30,\\nlunch 1, and camp at 7, and we get a short 8 hours\' sleep, but we are so\\ndead tired we could sleep half into the next day: we get about 9\xbd hours\'\\nmarch.

I knew I could ordinarily hold my own with him, but for the\\nfirst two hours we dropped till we were several hundred yards astern; try\\nas I would to rally up my team we could gain nothing. On examining the\\nrunners however we soon discovered the cause by the presence of a thin\\nfilm of ice. After that we ran easily. The thing one must avoid doing is\\nto touch them with the hand or mitt, as anything damp will make ice on\\nthem. We usually turn the sledge on its side and scrape one runner at a\\ntime with the back of our knives so as to avoid any chance of cutting or\\nchipping them. In the afternoon either the tea or the butter we had at\\nlunch made us so strong that we fairly overran the other team.\\"[230]\\n\\"We must push on all we can, for we are now 6 days behind Shackleton, all\\ndue to that wretched storm. So far, since we got among the disturbances\\nwe have not seen such alarming crevasses as I had expected; certainly\\ndogs could have come up as far as this.\\"[231]\\n[Illustration: MOUNT PATRICK--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\n\\"At lunch we could see big pressure ahead having done first over five\\nmiles. Soon after lunch, having gone down a bit, we rose among very rough\\nstuff. We plugged on until 4.30, when ski became quite impossible, and we\\nput them on the sledges and started on foot. We immediately began putting\\nlegs down: one step would be on blue ice and the next two feet down into\\nsnow: very hard going. The pressure ahead seemed to stretch right into a\\nbig glacier next the Keltie Glacier to the east, and so we altered course\\nfor a small bluff point about two-thirds of the way along the base of the\\nCloudmaker. We were to camp at 6, but did not do so until about 6.30, the\\nlast 1\xbd hours in big pressure, crossing big and smaller waves, and\\nhundreds of crevasses which one of us generally found. We are now camped\\nin very big pressure, and with difficulty we found a patch big enough to\\npitch the tent free from crevasses. We are pretty well past the Keltie\\nGlacier which is a vast tumbled mass: there is a long line of ice falls\\nahead, and I think there is a hard day ahead of us to-morrow among\\nthat pressure which must be enormous. We can\'t go farther inshore here,\\nbeing under the north end of the Cloudmaker, and a fine mountain it is,\\nrising precipitously above us.[232]\\n\\"Sunday, December 17. Nearly 11 miles. Temp. 12.5\xb0. 3500 feet. We have\\nhad an exciting day--this morning was just like the scenic railway at\\nEarl\'s Court. We got straight on to the big pressure waves, and headed\\nfor the humpy rock at the base of the Cloudmaker. It was a hard plug up\\nthe waves, very often standing pulls, and all that we could do for a\\ncourse was a very varied direction. Going down the other side was the\\nexciting part: all we could do was to set the sledge straight, hang on to\\nthe straps, give her a little push and rush down the slope, which was\\nsometimes so sheer that the sledge was in the air. Sometimes there was no\\nchance to brake the sledge, and we all had to get on to the top, and we\\nrushed down with the wind whistling in our ears. After three hours of\\nthis it levelled out again a bit, and we took the top of a wave, and ran\\nsouth along it on blue ice: enormous pressure to our right, largely I\\nthink caused by the Keltie Glacier. Then we ascended a rise, snowy and\\ncrevassed, and camped after doing just under five miles, with big\\npressure ahead.\\"[233]\\n\\"In the afternoon we had a hard surface. Scott started off at a great\\nspeed, Teddy [Evans] and I following. There was something wrong with my\\nteam or my sledge, as we had a desperate job to keep up at first. We did\\nkeep up all right, but were heartily glad when after about 2\xbd hours Scott\\nstopped for a spell. I rearranged our harness, putting Cherry and myself\\non the long span again, which we had temporarily discarded in the\\nmorning. We were both winded and felt wronged. The rearrangement was a\\nsuccess however, and the remainder of the march was a pleasure instead of\\na desperate struggle. It finished up on fields of blue rippled ice with\\nsharp knife edges, and snow patches few and far between. We are all\\ncamped on a small snow patch in the middle of a pale blue rippled sea,\\nabout 3600 feet above sea level and past the Cloudmaker, which means\\nthat we are half way up the Glacier.\\"[234] We had done 12\xbd miles\\n(statute).\\nThe Beardmore Glacier is twice as large as the Malaspina in Alaska, which\\nwas the largest known glacier until Shackleton discovered the Beardmore.\\nThose who knew the Ferrar Glacier professed to find the Beardmore\\nunattractive, but to me at any rate it was grand. Its very vastness,\\nhowever, tends to dwarf its surroundings, and great tributary glaciers\\nand tumbled ice-falls, which anywhere else would have aroused admiration,\\nwere almost unnoticed in a stream which stretched in places forty miles\\nfrom bank to bank. It was only when the theodolite was levelled that we\\nrealized how vast were the mountains which surrounded us: one of which we\\nreckoned to be well over twenty thousand feet in height, and many of the\\nothers must have approached that measurement. Lieutenant Evans and Bowers\\nwere surveying whenever the opportunity offered, whilst Wilson sat on the\\nsledge or on his sleeping-bag, and sketched.\\nBefore leaving on the morning of December 18 we bagged off three\\nhalf-weekly units and made a dep\xf4t marked by a red flag on a bamboo which\\nwas stuck into a small mound. Unfortunately it began to snow in the night\\nand no bearings were taken until the following morning when only the base\\nof the mountains on the west side was visible. We knew we might have\\ndifficulty in picking up this dep\xf4t again, and certainly we all did.\\n\\"It was thick, with low stratus clouds in the morning, and snow was\\nfalling in large crystals. Our socks and finnesko, hung out to dry, were\\ncovered with most beautiful feathery crystals. In the warm weather one\\ngets fairly saturated with perspiration on the march, and foot-gear is\\nalways wet, except the outside covering which is as a rule more or less\\nfrozen according to existing temperature. On camping at night I shift to\\nnight foot-gear as soon as ever the tent is pitched, and generally slip\\non my windproof blouse, as one cools down like smoke after the exertion\\nof man-hauling a heavy sledge for hours. At lunch camp one\'s feet often\\nget pretty cold, but this goes off as soon as some hot tea is got into\\nthe system. As a rule, even when snowing, one\'s socks, etc., will dry if\\nthere is a bit of a breeze. They are always frozen stiff in the morning\\nand can best be thawed out by bundling the lot [under one\'s] jersey\\nduring breakfast. They can then be put on tolerably warm even if wet.\\n\\"We started off on a hard rippled blue surface like a sea frozen intact\\nwhile the wind was playing on it. It soon got worse and we had to have\\none and sometimes two hands back to keep the sledge from skidding. Of\\ncourse it was easy enough stuff to pull on, but the ground was very\\nuneven, and sledges constantly capsized. It did not improve the runners\\neither. There were few crevasses.\\n\\"All day we went on in dull cloudy weather with hardly any land visible,\\nand the glacier to be seen only for a short distance. In the afternoon\\nthe clouds lifted somewhat and showed us the Adam Mountains. The surface\\nwas better for the sledges but worse for us, as there were countless\\ncracks and small crevasses, into which we constantly trod, barking our\\nshins. As the afternoon sun came round the perspiration fairly streamed\\ndown, and it was impossible to keep goggles clear. The surface was so\\nslippery and uneven that it was difficult to keep one\'s foothold. However\\nwe did 12\xbd miles, and felt that we had really done a good day\'s work when\\nwe camped. It was not clear enough to survey in the evening, so I took\\nthe sledge-meter in hand and worked at it half the night to repair\\nChristopher\'s damage.[235] I ended up by making a fixing of which I was\\nvery proud, but did not dare to look at the time, so I don\'t know how\\nmuch sleep I missed.\\n\\"There is no doubt that Scott knows where to aim for in a glacier, as it\\nwas just here that Shackleton had two or three of his worst days\' work,\\nin such a maze of crevasses that he said that often a slip meant death\\nfor the whole party. He avoids the sides of the glacier and goes nowhere\\nnear the snow: he often heads straight for apparent chaos and somehow,\\nwhen we appear to have reached a cul-de-sac, we find it an open\\nroad.\\"[236] However, we all found the trouble on our way back.\\n\\"On our right we have now a pretty good view of the Adam, Marshall and\\nWild Mountains, and their very curious horizontal stratification. Wright\\nhas found, amongst bits of wind-blown d\xe9bris, an undoubted bit of\\nsandstone and a bit of black basalt. We must get to know more of the\\ngeology before leaving the glacier finally.\\"[237]","image":null},{"merge":"C11.04","output":"{\'summary\': \'The explorers experienced difficult crevasse-filled terrain while on a march and covered almost 23 miles, but had to send a returning party including Birdie because of sledge and foot troubles, leaving 8 men to continue on their journey.\\\\n\',\\n \'excerpt_1\': \'The Mill Glacier is not, as was supposed, a tributary, but probably is an outlet falling from this\\\\n\\\\n\\"Scott is quite wonderful in his selections of route, as we have escaped excessive\\\\n\\\\ndangers and difficulties all along.\',\\n \'excerpt_2\': \'Most of them could be seen by the strip of snow\\\\non the blue ice.

Wilson, del.\\nEmery Walker Limited, Collotypers.]\\n\\"Angles and observations were taken at lunch, and quite a lot of work was\\ndone. There is a general getting squared up with gear, for we know that\\nthose going on will not have many more days of warm temperatures. At one\\ntime to-day I think Scott meant trying the right hand of the island or\\nnunatak, but as we rose this was obviously impossible, for there is a\\nhuge mass of pressure coming down there. From here the Dominion Range\\nalso looks as if it were a nunatak. Some of these mountains, which don\'t\\nlook very big, are huge (since the six thousand feet which we have risen\\nhave to be added on to them), and many of them are very grand indeed. The\\nMill Glacier is a vast thing, with big pressure across it. There also\\nseems to be a big series of ice-falls between Buckley Island and the\\nDominion Range, for the centre of which Scott is going to-morrow. A\\npretty hard plug this afternoon, but no disturbance, and gradually we\\nhave left the bare ice, and are mostly travelling on _n\xe9v\xe9_. Much of the\\nice is white. I have been writing down angles and times for Birdie, and\\nwriting this in the intervals. Scott\'s heel is troubling him again. [\'I\\nhave bad bruises on knee and thigh\'],[238] and generally there has been a\\nrun on the medical cases for chafes, and minor ailments. There is now a\\nkeen southerly wind blowing. It gets a little colder each day, and we are\\nalready beginning to feel it on our sunburnt faces and hands.\\"[239]\\nOf the crevasses met in the morning Bowers wrote: \\"So far nobody has\\ndropped down the length of his harness, as I did on the Cape Crozier\\njourney. On this blue ice they are pretty conspicuous, and as they are\\nmostly snow-bridged one is well advised to step over any line of snow.\\nWith my short legs this was strenuous work, especially as the weight of\\nthe sledge would often stop me with a jerk just before my leading foot\\nquite cleared a crevasse, and the next minute one would be struggling out\\nso as to keep the sledge on the move. It is fatal to stop the sledge as\\nnobody waits for stragglers, and you have to pick up your lost ground by\\nstrenuous hurry. Of course some one often gets so far down a hole that it\\nis necessary to stop and help him out.\\"\\nDecember 20. \\"To-day has been a great march--over two miles an hour, and\\non the whole rising a lot. Soon after starting we got on to the most\\nbeautiful icy surface, smooth except for cracks and only patches of snow,\\nmost of which we could avoid. We came along at a great rate.\\n\\"The most interesting thing to see was that the Mill Glacier is not, as\\nwas supposed, a tributary, but probably is an outlet falling from this\\nglacier, and a great size. However it was soon covered up with dense\\nblack cloud, and there were billows of cloud behind us and below.\\n\\"At lunch Birdie made the disastrous discovery that the registering dial\\nof his sledge-meter was off. A screw had shaken out on the bumpy ice,\\nand the clockwork had fallen off. This is serious for it means that one\\nof the three returning parties will have to go without, and their\\nnavigation will be much more difficult. Birdie is very upset, especially\\nafter all the trouble he has taken with it, and the hours which he has\\nsat up. After lunch he and Bill walked back near two miles in the tracks,\\nbut could not see it. It was then getting very thick, coming over from\\nthe north.\\"[240] \\"It appeared to be blizzing down the glacier, though\\nclear to the south. The northerly wind drove up a back-draught of snow,\\nand very soon fogged us completely. However we found our way back to camp\\nby the crampon tracks on the blue ice and then packed up to leave.\\"[241]\\n\\"We started, making a course to hit the east side of the island where\\nthere seems to be the only break in the ice-falls which stretch right\\nacross. The weather lifted, and we are now camped with the island just to\\nour right, the long strata of coal showing plainly in it, and just in\\nfront of us is this steep bit up through the falls. We have done nearly\\n23 statute miles to-day, pulling 160 lbs. a man.\\n\\"This evening has been rather a shock. As I was getting my finnesko on to\\nthe top of my ski beyond the tent Scott came up to me, and said that he\\nwas afraid he had rather a blow for me. Of course I knew what he was\\ngoing to say, but could hardly grasp that I was going back--to-morrow\\nnight. The returning party is to be Atch, Silas, Keohane and self.\\n[Illustration: NIGHT CAMP. BUCKLEY ISLAND--December 20, 1911]\\n\\"Scott was very put about, said he had been thinking a lot about it but\\nhad come to the conclusion that the seamen with their special knowledge,\\nwould be needed: to rebuild the sledge, I suppose. Wilson told me it was\\na toss-up whether Titus or I should go on: that being so I think Titus\\nwill help him more than I can. I said all I could think of--he seemed so\\ncut up about it, saying \'I think, somehow, it is specially hard on you.\'\\nI said I hoped I had not disappointed him, and he caught hold of me and\\nsaid \'No--no--No,\' so if that is the case all is well. He told me that at\\nthe bottom of the glacier he was hardly expecting to go on himself: I\\ndon\'t know what the trouble is, but his foot is troubling him, and also,\\nI think, indigestion.\\"[242]\\nScott just says in his diary, \\"I dreaded this necessity of\\nchoosing--nothing could be more heartrending.\\" And then he goes on to sum\\nup the situation, \\"I calculated our programme to start from 85\xb0 10\xb4 with\\n12 units of food and eight men. We ought to be in this position to-morrow\\nnight, less one day\'s food. After all our harassing trouble one cannot\\nbut be satisfied with such a prospect.\\"[243]\\nDecember 21. Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t. \\"Started off with a nippy S.Wly. wind\\nin our faces, but bright sunshine. One\'s nose and lips being chapped and\\nmuch skinned with alternate heat and cold, a breeze in the face is\\nabsolute agony until you warm up. This does not take long, however, when\\npulling a sledge, so after the first quarter of an hour more or less one\\nis comfortable unless the wind is very strong.\\n\\"We made towards the only place where it seemed possible to cross the\\nmass of pressure ice caused by the junction of the plateau with the\\nglacier, and congested between the nunatak [Buckley Island] and the\\nDominion Range. Scott had considered at one time going up to westward of\\nthe nunatak, but this appeared more chaotic than the other side. We made\\nfor a slope close to the end of the island or nunatak, where Shackleton\\nmust have got up also; it is obviously the only place when you look at it\\nfrom a commanding rise. We did not go quite so close to the land as\\nShackleton did, and therefore, as had been the case with us all the way\\nup the glacier, found less difficulties than he met with. Scott is quite\\nwonderful in his selections of route, as we have escaped excessive\\ndangers and difficulties all along. In this case we had fairly good\\ngoing, but got into a perfect mass of crevasses into which we all\\ncontinually fell; mostly one foot, but often two, and occasionally we\\nwent down altogether, some to the length of their harness to be hauled\\nout with the Alpine rope. Most of them could be seen by the strip of snow\\non the blue ice. They were often too wide to jump though, and the only\\nthing was to plant your feet on the bridge and try not to tread heavily.\\nAs a rule the centre of a bridged crevasse is the safest place, the\\nrotten places are at the edges. We had to go over dozens by hopping right\\non to the bridge and then over on to the ice. It is a bit of a jar when\\nit gives way under you, but the friendly harness is made to trust one\'s\\nlife to.

The time a\\nman can give to writing under such conditions is limited, and Bowers had\\na great deal of it to do before he could think of a diary--the\\nmeteorological log; sights for position as well as rating sights for\\ntime; and all the routine work of weights, provisions and dep\xf4ts.

I\\nrigged up the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t after breakfast. We dep\xf4ted two\\nhalf-weekly units for return of the two parties, also all crampons and\\nglacier gear, such as ice-axes, crowbar, spare Alpine rope, etc.,\\npersonal gear, medical, and in fact everything we could dispense with. I\\nleft my old finnesko, wind trousers and some other spare gear in a bag\\nfor going back.\\nThe two advance parties\' weights amounted to 190 lbs. per man. They\\nconsisted of the permanent weights, twelve weeks\' food and oil, spare\\nsledge runners, etc. We said good-bye and sent back messages and photo\\nfilms with the First Returning Party, which consisted of Atch, Cherry,\\nSilas and Keohane. It was quite touching saying farewell to our good\\npals--they wished us luck, and Cherry, Atch and Silas quite overwhelmed\\nme.\\nWe went forward, the Owner\'s team as before consisting of Dr. Bill, Titus\\nand [Seaman] Evans, and [Lieut.] Teddy Evans and Lashly coming over to my\\nsledge and tent to join up with Crean and myself. We all left the dep\xf4t\\ncairn marked with two spare 10-feet sledge runners and a large black flag\\non one. Our morning march was not so long as usual owing to making up the\\ndep\xf4t, but we did five miles uphill, hauling our heavier loads more\\neasily than the lighter ones yesterday. A fall in the temperature had\\nimproved the surface. We had also sandpapered our runners after the\\ntearing up they had had on the glacier; this made a tremendous\\ndifference. The afternoon march brought our total up to 10.6 miles for\\nthe day on a S.W. course.\\nWe are steering S.W. with a view to avoiding ice-falls which Shackleton\\nmet with. We came across very few crevasses; the few we found were as\\nbroad as a street, and crossing them the whole party, sledge and all,\\nwould be on the bridge at once. They only gave way at the edges, and we\\ndid nothing worse than put our feet through now and then. The surface is\\nall snow now, n\xe9v\xe9 and hard sastrugi, which seem to point to a strong\\nprevalent S.S.E. wind here.\\nWe are well clear of the land now, and it is a beautiful evening. I have\\njust taken six photographs of the Dominion Range. We can see many new\\nmountains. Our position by observation is 85\xb0 13\xb4 29\\" S., 161\xb0 54\xb4 45\\"\\nE., variation being 175\xb0 45\xb4.\\nDecember 23. Turned out at usual time, 5.45 A.M. I am cook this week in\\nour tent. After breakfast built two cairns to mark spot and shoved off at\\nquarter to eight.\\nWe started up a big slope on a S.W. course to avoid the pressure which\\nlay across our track to the southward. It was a pretty useful slog up the\\nrise, at one time it seemed as if we would never top the slope. We\\nstopped for five minutes to look round after 2\xbd hours\' hard plugging and\\nabout 1\xbd hours later reached the top, from which we could see the distant\\nmountains which have so recently been our companions. They are beginning\\nto look pretty magnificent. The top of the great pressure ridge was\\nrunning roughly S.E. and N.W.: it was one of a succession of ridges which\\nprobably cover an area of fifty or sixty square miles. In this\\nneighbourhood Shackleton met them almost to 86\xbd\xb0 south. At the top of the\\nridge were vast crevasses into which we could have dropped the Terra Nova\\neasily. The bridges were firm, however, except at the sides, though we\\nhad frequent stumbles into the conservatory roof, so to speak. The\\nsledges were rushed over them without mishap. We had to head farther west\\nto clear disturbances, and at one time were going W.N.W.\\nAt lunch camp we had done 8\xbd miles, and in the afternoon we completed\\nfifteen on a S.W. course over improved ground. Our routine is to actually\\nhaul our sledges for nine hours a day; five in the morning, 7.15 A.M.\\ntill 1 P.M.; and four in the afternoon, 2.30 P.M.-6.30 P.M. We turn out\\nat 5.45 A.M. just now. The loads are still pretty heavy, but the surface\\nis remarkably good considering all things. One gets pretty weary towards\\nthe end of the day; all my muscles have had their turn at being\\n[stiffened] up. These hills are giving my back ones a reminder, but they\\nwill ache less to-morrow and finally cease to do so, as is the case with\\nlegs, etc., which had their turn first.\\nDecember 24. _Christmas Eve._ We started off heading due south this\\nmorning, as we are many miles to the westward of Shackleton\'s course and\\nshould if anywhere be clear of the ice-falls and pressure. Of course no\\nmortals having been here, one can only conjecture; as a matter of fact,\\nwe found later in the day that we were not clear by any means, and had to\\ndo a bit of dodging about to avoid disturbances, as well as mount vast\\nridges with the tops of them a chaos of crevasses. The tops are pretty\\nhard ice-snow, over which the sledges run easily; it is quite a holiday\\nafter slogging up the slopes on the softer surface with our heavy loads,\\nwhich amount to over 190 lbs. per man.\\nWe mark our night camp by two cairns and our lunch camp by single ones.\\nIt is doubtful, however, among these ridges, if we will ever pick them up\\nagain, and it does not really matter, as we have excellent land for the\\nUpper Glacier Dep\xf4t. We completed fourteen miles and turned in as usual\\npretty tired.\\nDecember 25. _Christmas Day._ A strange and strenuous Christmas for me,\\nwith plenty of snow to look at and very little else. The breeze that had\\nblown in our faces all yesterday blew more freshly to-day, with surface\\ndrift. It fairly nipped one\'s nose and face starting off--until one got\\nwarmed up. We had to pull in wind blouses, as though one\'s body kept warm\\nenough on the march the arms got numbed with the penetrating wind no\\nmatter how vigorously they were swung. Another thing is that one cannot\\nstop the team on the march to get clothes on and off, so it is better to\\ngo the whole hog and be too hot than cause delays. We had the addition of\\na little pony meat for breakfast to celebrate the day.

About the middle of the morning we were all falling in\\ncontinually, but Lashly in my team had the worst drop. He fell to the\\nlength of his harness and the trace. I was glad that having noticed his\\nrope rather worn, I had given him a new one a few days before. He jerked\\nCrean and me off our feet backwards, and Crean\'s harness being jammed\\nunder the sledge, which was half across an eight-feet bridge, he could do\\nnothing. I was a little afraid of sledge and all going down, but\\nfortunately the crevasse ran diagonally. We could not see Lashly, for a\\ngreat overhanging piece of ice was over him. Teddy Evans and I cleared\\nCrean and we all three got Lashly up with the Alpine rope cut into the\\nsnow sides which overhung the hole. We then got the sledge into safety.\\nTo-day is Lashly\'s birthday; he is married and has a family; is 44 years\\nof age, and due for his pension from the service. He is as strong as most\\nand is an undefeated old sportsman. Being a chief stoker, R.N., his\\noriginal job was charge of one of the ill-fated motor sledges.\\n[The following is Lashly\'s own account:\\n\\"Christmas Day and a good one. We have done 15 miles over a very changing\\nsurface. First of all it was very much crevassed and pretty rotten; we\\nwere often in difficulties as to which way we should tackle it. I had the\\nmisfortune to drop clean through, but was stopped with a jerk when at the\\nend of my harness. It was not of course a very nice sensation, especially\\non Christmas Day, and being my birthday as well. While spinning round in\\nspace like I was it took me a few seconds to gather together my thoughts\\nand see what kind of a place I was in. It certainly was not a fairy\'s\\nplace. When I had collected myself I heard some one calling from above,\\n\'Are you all right, Lashly?\' I was all right it is true, but I did not\\ncare to be dangling in the air on a piece of rope, especially when I\\nlooked round and saw what kind of a place it was. It seemed about 50 feet\\ndeep and 8 feet wide, and 120 feet long. This information I had ample\\ntime to gain while dangling there. I could measure the width with my ski\\nsticks, as I had them on my wrists. It seemed a long time before I saw\\nthe rope come down alongside me with a bowline in it for me to put my\\nfoot in and get dragged out. It was not a job I should care to have to go\\nthrough often, as by being in the crevasse I had got cold and a bit\\nfrost-bitten on the hands and face, which made it more difficult for me\\nto help myself. Anyhow Mr. Evans, Bowers and Crean hauled me out and\\nCrean wished me many happy returns of the day, and of course I thanked\\nhim politely and the others laughed, but all were pleased I was not hurt\\nbar a bit of a shake. It was funny although they called to the other team\\nto stop they did not hear, but went trudging on and did not know until\\nthey looked round just in time to see me arrive on top again. They then\\nwaited for us to come up with them. The Captain asked if I was all right\\nand could go on again, which I could honestly say \'Yes\' to, and at night\\nwhen we stopped for dinner I felt I could do two dinners in. Anyhow we\\nhad a pretty good tuck-in. Dinner consisted of pemmican, biscuits,\\nchocolate \xe9clair, pony meat, plum pudding and crystallized ginger and\\nfour caramels each. We none of us could hardly move.\\"[247]]\\nWe had done over eight miles at lunch. I had managed to scrape together\\nfrom the Barrier rations enough extra food to allow us a stick of\\nchocolate each for lunch, with two spoonfuls of raisins each in our tea.\\nIn the afternoon we got clear of crevasses pretty soon, but towards the\\nend of the afternoon Captain Scott got fairly wound up and went on and\\non. The breeze died down and my breath kept fogging my glasses, and our\\nwindproofs got oppressively warm and altogether things were pretty\\nrotten. At last he stopped and we found we had done 14\xbe miles. He said,\\n\\"What about fifteen miles for Christmas Day?\\" so we gladly went\\non--anything definite is better than indefinite trudging.\\nWe had a great feed which I had kept hidden and out of the official\\nweights since our departure from Winter Quarters. It consisted of a good\\nfat hoosh with pony meat and ground biscuit; a chocolate hoosh made of\\nwater, cocoa, sugar, biscuit, raisins, and thickened with a spoonful of\\narrowroot. (This is the most satisfying stuff imaginable.) Then came 2\xbd\\nsquare inches of plum-duff each, and a good mug of cocoa washed down the\\nwhole. In addition to this we had four caramels each and four squares of\\ncrystallized ginger. I positively could not eat all mine, and turned in\\nfeeling as if I had made a beast of myself. I wrote up my journal--in\\nfact I should have liked somebody to put me to bed.\\nDecember 26. We have seen many new ranges of mountains extending to the\\nS.E. of the Dominion Range. They are very distant, however, and must\\nevidently be the top of those bounding the Barrier. They could only be\\nseen from the tops of the ridges as waves up which we are continually\\nmounting. Our height yesterday morning by hypsometer was 8000 feet. That\\nis our last hypsometer record, as I had the misfortune to break the\\nthermometer. The hypsometer was one of my chief delights, and nobody\\ncould have been more disgusted than myself at its breaking. However, we\\nhave the aneroid to check the height. We are going gradually up and up.\\nAs one would expect, a considerable amount of lassitude was felt over\\nbreakfast after our feed last night. The last thing on earth I wanted to\\ndo was to ship the harness round my poor tummy when we started. As usual\\na stiff breeze from the south and a temperature of -7\xb0 blew in our faces.\\nStrange to say, however, we don\'t get frost-bitten. I suppose it is the\\nopen-air life.\\nI could not tell if I had a frost-bite on my face now, as it is all\\nscales, so are my lips and nose. A considerable amount of red hair is\\nendeavouring to cover up matters. We crossed several ridges, and after\\nthe effects of over-feeding had worn off did a pretty good march of\\nthirteen miles.\\n[No more Christmas Days, so no more big hooshes.[248]]\\nDecember 27. There is something the matter with our sledge or our team,\\nas we have an awful slog to keep up with the others. I asked Dr. Bill and\\nhe said their sledge ran very easily. Ours is nothing but a desperate\\ndrag with constant rallies to keep up. We certainly manage to do so, but\\nI am sure we cannot keep this up for long. We are all pretty well done up\\nto-night after doing 13.3 miles.\\nOur salvation is on the summits of the ridges, where hard n\xe9v\xe9 and\\nsastrugi obtain, and we skip over this slippery stuff and make up lost\\nground easily. In soft snow the other team draw steadily ahead, and it is\\nfairly heart-breaking to know you are putting your life out hour after\\nhour while they go along with little apparent effort.\\nDecember 28. The last few days have been absolutely cloudless, with\\nunbroken sunshine for twenty-four hours. It sounds very nice, but the\\ntemperature never comes above zero and what Shackleton called \\"the\\npitiless increasing wind\\" of the great plateau continues to blow at all\\ntimes from the south. It never ceases, and all night it whistles round\\nthe tents, all day it blows in our faces. Sometimes it is S.S.E., or S.E.\\nto S., and sometimes even S. to W., but always southerly, chiefly\\naccompanied by low drift which at night forms quite a deposit round the\\nsledges. We expected this wind, so we must not growl at getting it. It\\nwill be great fun sailing the sledges back before it. As far as weather\\nis concerned we have had remarkably fine days up here on this limitless\\nsnow plain. I should like to know what there is beneath us--mountains and\\nvalleys simply levelled off to the top with ice? We constantly come\\nacross disturbances which I can only imagine are caused by the peaks of\\nice-covered mountains, and no doubt some of the ice-falls and crevasses\\nare accountable to the same source. Our coming west has not cleared them,\\nas we have seen more disturbances to the west, many miles away. However,\\nthey are getting less and less, and are now nothing but featureless rises\\nwith apparently no crevasses. Our first two hours\' pulling to-day....\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n_From Lashly\'s Diary_\\nDecember 29, 1911.

After doing 7 miles we camped and done the sledges\\nwhich took us until 11 P.M., and we had to dig out to get them done by\\nthen, made a dep\xf4t and saw the old year out and the new year in. We all\\nwondered where we should be next New Year.

Also he was in a hurry, he always was.\\nThat blizzard which had delayed him just before the Gateway, and the\\nresulting surfaces which had delayed him in the lower reaches of the\\nglacier! One can feel the averages running through his brain: so many\\nmiles to-day: so many more to-morrow. When shall we come to an end of\\nthis pressure? Can we go straight or must we go more west? And then the\\ngreat undulating waves with troughs eight miles wide, and the buried\\nmountains, causing whirlpools in the ice--how immense, and how annoying.\\nThe monotonous march: the necessity to keep the mind concentrated to\\nsteer amongst disturbances: the relief of a steady plod when the\\ndisturbances cease for a time: then more pressure and more crevasses.\\nAlways slog on, slog on. Always a fraction of a mile more.... On December\\n30 he writes, \\"We have caught up Shackleton\'s dates.\\"[249]\\nThey made wonderful marches, averaging nearly fifteen statute miles (13\\ngeog.) a day for the whole-day marches until the Second Return Party\\nturned back on January 4. Scott writes on December 26, \\"It seems\\nastonishing to be disappointed with a march of 15 (statute) miles when I\\nhad contemplated doing little more than 10 with full loads.\\"[250]\\nThe Last Returning Party came back with the news that Scott must reach\\nthe Pole with the greatest ease. This seemed almost a certainty: and yet\\nit was, as we know now, a false impression. Scott\'s plans were based on\\nShackleton\'s averages over the same country. The blizzard came and put\\nhim badly behind: but despite this he caught Shackleton up. No doubt the\\ngeneral idea then was that Scott was going to have a much easier time\\nthan he had expected. We certainly did not realize then, and I do not\\nthink Scott himself had any notion of, the price which had been paid.\\nOf the three teams of four men each which started from the bottom of the\\nBeardmore, Scott\'s team was a very long way the strongest: it was the\\nteam which, with one addition, went to the Pole. Lieutenant Evans\' team\\nhad mostly done a lot of man-hauling already: it was hungry and I think a\\nbit stale. Bowers\' team was fresh and managed to keep up for the most\\npart, but it was very done at the end of the day. Scott\'s own team went\\nalong with comparative ease. From the top of the glacier two teams went\\non during the last fortnight of which we have been speaking. The first of\\nthem was Scott\'s unit complete, just as it had pulled up the glacier. The\\nsecond team consisted, I believe, of the men whom Scott considered to be\\nthe strongest; two from Evans\' team, and two from Bowers\'. All Scott\'s\\nteam were fresh to the extent that they had done no man-hauling until we\\nstarted up the glacier. But two of the other team, Lieutenant Evans and\\nLashly, had been man-hauling since the breakdown of the second motor on\\nNovember 1. They had man-hauled four hundred statute miles farther than\\nthe rest. Indeed Lashly\'s man-hauling journey from Corner Camp to beyond\\n87\xb0 32\xb4 S., and back, is one of the great feats of polar travelling.\\nSurely and not very slowly, Scott\'s team began to wear down the other\\nteam. They were going easily when the others were making heavy weather\\nand were sometimes far behind. During the fortnight they rose, according\\nto the corrected observations, from 7151 feet (Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t) to\\n9392 feet above sea level (Three Degree Dep\xf4t). The rarefied air of the\\nPlateau with its cold winds and lower temperatures, just now about -10\xb0\\nto -12\xb0 at night and -3\xb0 during the day, were having their effect on the\\nsecond team, as well as the forced marches. This is quite clear from\\nScott\'s diary, and from the other diaries also. What did not appear until\\nafter the Last Returning Party had turned homewards was that the first\\nteam was getting worn out too. This team which had gone so strong up the\\nglacier, which had done those amazingly good marches on the plateau,\\nbroke up unexpectedly and in some respects rapidly from the 88th parallel\\nonwards.\\nSeaman Evans was the first man to crack. He was the heaviest, largest,\\nmost muscular man we had, and that was probably one of the main reasons:\\nfor his allowance of food was the same as the others. But one mishap\\nwhich contributed to his collapse seems to have happened during this\\nfirst fortnight on the plateau. On December 31 the 12-feet sledges were\\nturned into 10-feet ones by stripping off the old scratched runners which\\nhad come up the glacier and shipping new 10-feet ones which had been\\nbrought for the purpose. This job was done by the seamen, and Evans\\nappears to have had some accident to his hand, which is mentioned several\\ntimes afterwards.\\nMeanwhile Scott had to decide whom he was going to take on with him to\\nthe Pole,--for it was becoming clear that in all probability he _would_\\nreach the Pole: \\"What castles one builds now hopefully that the Pole is\\nours,\\" he wrote the day after the supporting party left him. The final\\nadvance to the Pole was, according to plan, to have been made by four\\nmen. We were organized in four-man units: our rations were made up for\\nfour men for a week: our tents held four men: our cookers held four mugs,\\nfour pannikins and four spoons. Four days before the Supporting Party\\nturned, Scott ordered the second sledge of four men to dep\xf4t their ski.\\nIt is clear, I suppose, that at this time he meant the Polar Party to\\nconsist of four men. I think there can be no doubt that he meant one of\\nthose men to be himself: \\"for your own ear also, I am exceedingly fit and\\ncan go with the best of them,\\" he wrote from the top of the glacier.[251]\\nHe changed his mind and went forward a party of five: Scott, Wilson,\\nBowers, Oates and Seaman Evans. I am sure he wished to take as many men\\nas possible to the Pole. He sent three men back: Lieutenant Evans in\\ncharge, and two seamen, Lashly and Crean. It is the vivid story of those\\nthree men, who turned on January 4 in latitude 87\xb0 32\xb4, which is told by\\nLashly in the next chapter. Scott wrote home: \\"A last note from a hopeful\\nposition. I think it\'s going to be all right. We have a fine party going\\nforward and arrangements are all going well.\\"[252]\\nTen months afterwards we found their bodies.\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [247] Lashly\'s diary.\\n   [248] Lashly\'s diary.\\n   [249] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 525.\\n   [250] Ibid. p. 521.\\n   [251] _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 513.\\n   [252] Ibid. p. 529.\\n\\n\\n","image":null},{"merge":"C13.01","output":"This passage recounts the return journeys of various parties from the South Pole expedition, including the First Supporting Party and the Last Supporting Party.

They reached Hut Point February 22, 1912.\\nOf the three teams which started up the Beardmore Glacier the first to\\nreturn, a fortnight after starting the Summit Rations, was known as the\\nFirst Supporting Party: the second to return, a month after starting the\\nSummit Rations, was known as the Last Supporting Party. Of the two\\ndog-teams under Meares, which had already turned homewards at the bottom\\nof the glacier after having been brought forward farther than had been\\nintended, I will speak later.[253]\\nI am going to say very little about the First Return Party, which\\nconsisted of Atkinson, Wright, Keohane and myself. Atkinson was in\\ncommand, and before we left Scott told him to bring the dog-teams out to\\nmeet the Polar Party if, as seemed likely, Meares returned home. Atkinson\\nis a naval surgeon and you will find this party referred to in Lashly\'s\\ndiary as \\"the Doctor\'s.\\"\\n\\"It was a sad job saying good-bye. It was thick, snowing and drifting\\nclouds when we started back after making the dep\xf4t, and the last we saw\\nof them as we swung the sledge north was a black dot just disappearing\\nover the next ridge and a big white pressure wave ahead of them.... Scott\\nsaid some nice things when we said good-bye. Anyway he has only to\\naverage seven miles a day to get to the Pole on full rations--it\'s\\npractically a cert for him. I do hope he takes Bill and Birdie. The view\\nover the ice-falls and pressure by the Mill Glacier from the top of the\\nice-falls is one of the finest things I have ever seen. Atch is doing us\\nproud.\\"[254]\\nNo five hundred mile journey down the Beardmore and across the Barrier\\ncan be uneventful, even in midsummer. We had the same dreary drag, the\\nsame thick weather, fears and anxieties which other parties have had. A\\ntouch of the same dysentery and sickness: the same tumbles and crevasses:\\nthe same Christmas comforts, a layer of plum pudding at the bottom of our\\ncocoa, and some rocks collected from a moraine under the Cloudmaker: the\\nsame groping for tracks: the same cairns lost and found, the same\\nsnow-blindness and weariness, nightmares, food dreams.... Why repeat?\\nComparatively speaking it was a very little journey: and yet the distance\\nfrom Cape Evans to the top of the Beardmore Glacier and back is 1164\\nstatute miles. Scott\'s Southern Journey of 1902-3 was 950 statute miles.\\nOne day only is worth recalling. We got into the same big pressure above\\nthe Cloudmaker which both the other parties experienced. But where the\\nother two parties made east to get out of it, we went west at Wright\'s\\nsuggestion: west was right. The day really lives in my memory because of\\nthe troubles of Keohane. He fell into crevasses to the full length of his\\nharness eight times in twenty-five minutes. Little wonder he looked a bit\\ndazed. And Atkinson went down into one chasm head foremost: the worst\\ncrevasse fall I\'ve ever seen. But luckily the shoulder straps of his\\nharness stood the strain and we pulled him up little the worse.\\nAll three parties off the plateau owed a good deal to Meares, who, on his\\nreturn with the two dog-teams, built up the cairns which had been\\nobliterated by the big blizzard of December 5-8. The ponies\' walls were\\ndrifted level with the surface, and Meares himself had an anxious time\\nfinding his way home. The dog tracks also helped us a good deal: the dogs\\nwere sinking deeply and making heavy weather of it.\\n[Illustration: ADAMS MOUNTAINS]\\n[Illustration: Cherry-Garrard. Keohane. Atkinson--FIRST RETURN PARTY]\\nAt the Barrier Dep\xf4ts we found rather despondent notes from Meares about\\nhis progress. To the Southern Barrier Dep\xf4t he had uncomfortably high\\ntemperatures and a very soft surface, and found the cairns drifted up and\\nhard to see. At the Middle Barrier Dep\xf4t we found a note from him dated\\nDecember 20. \\"Thick weather and blizzards had delayed him, and once he\\nhad got right off the tracks and had been out from his camp hunting for\\nthem. They were quite well: a little eye strain from searching for\\ncairns. He was taking a little butter from each bag [of the three dep\xf4ted\\nweekly units], and with this would have enough to the next dep\xf4t on short\\nrations.\\"[255] At the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t [Mount Hooper] the news from\\nMeares was dated Christmas Eve, in the evening: \\"The dogs were going\\nslowly but steadily in very soft stuff, especially his last two days.\\nHe was running short of food, having only biscuit crumbs, tea, some\\ncornflour, and half a cup of pemmican. He was therefore taking fifty\\nbiscuits, and a day\'s provisions for two men from each of our units.

This will be our last night together, as we are\\nto return to-morrow after going on in the forenoon with the party chosen\\nfor the Pole, that is Capt. Scott, Dr. Wilson, Capt. Oates, Lieut. Bowers\\nand Taff Evans. The Captain said he was satisfied we were all in good\\ncondition, fit to do the journey, but only so many could go on, so it was\\nhis wish Mr. Evans, Crean and myself should return. He was quite aware we\\nshould have a very stiff job, but we told him we did not mind that,\\nproviding he thought they could reach the Pole with the assistance we had\\nbeen able to give them. The first time I have heard we were having mules\\ncoming down to assist us next year. I was offering to remain at Hut\\nPoint, to be there if any help was needed, but the Captain said it was\\nhis and also Capt. Oates\' wish if the mules arrived I was to take charge\\nof and look after them until their return; but if they did not arrive\\nthere was no reason why I should not come to Hut Point and wait their\\nreturn. We had a long talk with the owner [Scott] in our tent about\\nthings in general and he seemed pretty confident of success. He seemed a\\nbit afraid of us getting hung up, but as he said we had a splendid\\nnavigator, who he was sure he could trust to pull us through. He also\\nthanked us all heartily for the way we had assisted in the Journey and he\\nshould be sorry when we parted. We are of course taking the mail, but\\nwhat a time before we get back to send it. We are nearly as far as\\nShackleton was on his Journey. I shall not write more to-night, it is too\\ncold.\\n    _4th January 1912._\\nWe accompanied the Pole party for about five miles and everything seemed\\nto be going pretty well and Capt. Scott said they felt confident they\\ncould pull the load quite well, so there was no more need for us to go\\non farther; so we stopped and did all the talking we could in a short\\ntime. We wished them every success and a safe return, and asked each one\\nif there was anything we could do for them when we got back, but they\\nwere all satisfied they had left nothing undone, so the time came for the\\nlast handshake and good-bye. I think we all felt it very much. They then\\nwished us a speedy return and safe, and then they moved off. We gave them\\nthree cheers, and watched them for a while until we began to feel cold.\\nThen we turned and started for home. We soon lost sight of each other. We\\ntravelled a long time so as to make the best of it while the weather was\\nsuitable, as we have to keep up a good pace on the food allowance. It\\nwont do to lay up much. One thing since we left Mt. Darwin, we have had\\nweather we could travel in, although we have not seen the sun much of\\nlate. We did 13 miles as near as we can guess by the cairns we have\\npassed. We have not got a sledge meter so shall have to go by guess all\\nthe way home.\\n[Owing to the loss of a sledge meter on the Beardmore Glacier one of the\\nthree parties had to return without one.

We have got to change our\\npulling billets. Crean has become snow-blind to-day through being leader,\\nso I shall have the job to-morrow, as Mr. Evans seems to get blind rather\\nquickly, so if I lead and he directs me from behind we ought to get along\\npretty well. I hope my eyes will keep alright. We made good 17 miles and\\ncamped.\\n    _6th January 1912._\\nWe are making good progress on the surface we have to contend with. We\\npicked up the 3 Degree Dep\xf4t soon after noon, which puts us up to time.\\nWe took our provision for a week. We have got to reach Mt. Darwin Dep\xf4t,\\na distance of 120 miles, with 7 days\' provisions. We picked up our ski\\nand camped for the night. We have been wondering if the others have got\\nthe same wind as us. If so it is right in their face, whereas it is at\\nour back, a treat to what it is facing it. Crean\'s eyes are pretty bad\\nto-night. Snow-blindness is an awful complaint, and no one I can assure\\nyou looks forward with pleasure when it begins to attack.\\n    _7th January 1912._\\nWe have had a very good day as far as travelling goes, the wind has been\\nbehind us and is a great help to us. We have been on ski all day for the\\nfirst time. It seems a good change to footing it, the one thing day after\\nday gets on one\'s nerves. Crean\'s eyes are a bit better to-day, but far\\nfrom being well. The temperature is pretty low, which dont improve the\\nsurface for hauling, but we seem to be getting along pretty well. We have\\nno sledge meter so we have to go by guess. Mr. Evans says we done 17\xbd\\nmiles, but I say 16\xbd. I am not going to over-estimate our day\'s run, as I\\nam taking charge of the biscuits so that we dont over-step the mark. This\\nwe have all agreed to so that we should exactly know how we stand, from\\nday to day. I am still leading, not very nice as the light is bad. We\\ncaught a glimpse of the land to the east of us, but could only have been\\na mirage.\\n    _8th January 1912._\\nOn turning out this morning we found it was blowing a bliz. so it was\\nalmost a case of having to remain in camp, but on second thoughts we\\nthought it best to kick off as we cant afford to lay up on account of\\nfood, so thought it best to push on. I wonder if the Pole Party have\\nexperienced this. If so they could not travel as it would be in their\\nface, where we have got it at our back. We have lost the outward bound\\ntrack, so have decided to make a straight line to Mt. Darwin, which will\\nbe on Shackleton\'s course according to his and Wild\'s Diary.\\n[Each of the three parties which went forward up the Beardmore Glacier\\ncarried extracts from the above diaries.

At first we got into some very rough\\nstuff, with plenty of crevasses. Had to get rid of the ski and put our\\nthinking cap on, as we had not got under way long before we were at the\\ntop of some ice-falls; these probably are what Shackleton spoke of. We\\ncould see it meant a descent of 600/700 feet, or make a big circuit,\\nwhich meant a lot of time and a big delay, and this we cant afford just\\nnow, so we decided on the descent into the valley. This proved a\\ndifficult task, as we had no crampons, having left them at Mt. Darwin\\nDep\xf4t; but we managed after a time by getting hold of the sledge each\\nside and allowing her to run into a big lump of pressure which was we\\nknew a risky thing to do. It took us up to lunch time to reach the\\nvalley, where we camped for lunch, where we all felt greatly relieved,\\nhaving accomplished the thing safely, no damage to ourselves or the\\nsledge, but we lost one of Crean\'s ski sticks. Some of the crevasses we\\ncrossed were 100 to 200 feet wide, but well bridged in the centre, but\\nthe edges were very dangerous indeed. This is where the snow and ice\\nbegins to roll down the glacier. After starting on our way again we found\\nwe had to climb the hill. Things dont look very nice ahead again\\nto-night. We dont seem to be more than a day\'s run from the dep\xf4t, but it\\nwill surprise me if we reach it by to-morrow night; if not we shall have\\nto go on short rations, as our supply is nearly run out, and we have not\\nlost any time, but we knew on starting we had to average 15\xbd miles per\\nday to reach it in time.\\n    _13th January 1912._\\nThis has been a very bad day for us, what with ice-falls and crevasses.\\nWe feel all full up to-night. The strain is tremendous some days. We are\\ncamped, but not at the dep\xf4t, but we hope to pick it up some time\\nto-morrow. We shall be glad to get off the Summit, as the temperature is\\nvery low. We expected the party would have reached the Pole yesterday,\\nproviding they had anything of luck.\\n[Scott reached the Pole on January 17.]\\n    _14th January 1912._\\nSunday, we reached the Mt. Darwin Dep\xf4t at 2 P.M. and camped for lunch.\\nWe had just enough now for our meal; this is cutting it a bit fine. We\\nhave now taken our 3\xbd days\' allowance, which has got to take us another\\n57 miles to the Cloudmaker Dep\xf4t. This we shall do if we all keep as fit\\nas we seem just now. We left a note at the dep\xf4t to inform the Captain of\\nour safe arrival, wishing them the best of a journey home. We are quite\\ncheerful here to-night, after having put things right at the dep\xf4t, where\\nwe found the sugar exposed to the sun; it had commenced to melt, but we\\nput everything alright before we left, and picked up our crampons and\\ngot away as soon as we could. We know there is not much time to spare. We\\nare now beginning to descend rapidly. To-night it is quite warm, and our\\ntea and food is warmer. Things are going pretty favourable. We are\\nlooking forward to making good runs down the glacier. We have had some\\nvery heavy dragging lately [up] the sharp rises we found on the outward\\njourney. After a sharp rise we found a long gradual run down, two and\\nthree miles in length. We noticed this on our outward journey and\\nremarked on it, but coming back the long uphill drag we found out was\\npretty heavy work.\\n    _15th January 1912._\\nHad a good run to-day but the ice was very rough and very much crevassed,\\nbut with crampons on we made splendid progress. We did not like to stop,\\nbut we thought it would not be advisable to overdo our strength as it is\\na long way to go yet.\\n    _16th January 1912._\\nWe made good headway again to-day, but to-night we camped in some very\\nrough ice and pressure ridges. We are under the impression we are\\nslightly out of our proper course, but Mr. Evans thinks we cant be very\\nfar out either way, and Crean and I are of the same opinion according to\\nthe marks on the land. Anyhow we hope to get out of it in the morning and\\nmake the Cloudmaker Dep\xf4t by night. We shall then feel safe, but the\\nweather dont look over promising again to-night, I am thinking. So far we\\nhave not had to stop for weather. We have wondered if the Pole Party have\\nbeen as lucky with the weather as we have. They ought by now to be\\nhomeward bound. We have more chance now of writing as the temperature is\\nmuch better down here. To-night we have been discussing how the dogs got\\nhome, and also the progress made by the Doctor\'s [Atkinson] Party. They\\nought to be nearing home. We have thought of the time it will take us to\\nreach it at the rate we are getting along now.\\n    _17th January 1912._\\nWe have to-day experienced what we none of us ever wants to be our lot\\nagain. I cannot describe the maze we got into and the hairbreadth escapes\\nwe have had to pass through to-day. This day we shall remember all our\\nlives. The more we tried to get clear the worse the pressure got; at\\ntimes it seemed almost impossible for us to get along, and when we had\\ngot over the places it was more than we could face to try and retreat; so\\nwe struggled on for hours to try and free ourselves, but everything\\nseemed against us. I was leading with a long trace so that I could get\\nacross some of the ridges when we thought it possible to get the sledge\\nover without being dashed down into the fathomless pits each side of us\\nwhich were too numerous to think of. Often and often we saw openings\\nwhere it was possible to drop the biggest ship afloat in and loose her.\\nThis is what we have travelled over all day. It has been a great strain\\non us all, and Mr. Evans is rather down and thinks he has led us into\\nsuch a hole, but as we have told him it is no fault of his, as it is\\nimpossible for anyone coming down the glacier to see what is ahead of\\nthem, so we must be thankful that we are so far safe. To-night we seem to\\nbe in a better place. We have camped not being able to reach the dep\xf4t,\\nwhich we are certain is not far off. Dont want many days like this.\\n[Illustration: BELOW THE CLOUDMAKER]\\n    _18th January 1912._\\nWe started off all in good spirits trusting we should be able to reach\\nthe dep\xf4t all in good time, but we had not got far before we came into\\npressure far worse than we were in yesterday. My God! what a day this\\nhave been for us all. I cannot describe what we really have to-day come\\nthrough, no one could believe that we came through with safety, if we had\\nonly had a camera we could have obtained some photographs that would have\\nsurprised anyone living. We travelled all day with very little food, as\\nwe are a day and a half overdue, but when we got clear, I can say \\"clear\\"\\nnow because I am dotting down this at the dep\xf4t where we have arrived. I\\nhad managed to keep behind just a small amount of biscuit and a drop of\\ntea to liven us up to try and reach the dep\xf4t, which we reached at 11\\nP.M. after one of the most trying days of my life. Shall have reason to\\nnever forget the 17 and 18 of January, 1912. To-night Mr. Evans is\\ncomplaining of his eyes, more trouble ahead!\\n    _19th January 1912._\\nAfter putting the dep\xf4t in order and re-arranging things, we kicked off\\nagain for D. [Lower Glacier] Dep\xf4t. Mr. Evans\' eyes were very bad on\\nstarting this morning, but we made a pretty good start. I picked some\\nrock to-day which I intend to try and get back with, as it is the only\\nchance we have had of getting any up to the present, and it seemed a\\nfunny thing: the rock I got some pieces of looked as if someone before me\\nhad been chipping some off. I wonder if it was the Doctor\'s party, but we\\ncould not see any trace of their sledge, but we could account for that,\\nas it was all blue ice and not likely to leave any marks behind. After\\ntravelling for some distance we got on the same ridge as we ran along on\\nthe outward Journey and passed what we took to be the Doctor\'s Xmas Camp.\\nWe had not gone far past before we got into soft snow, so we decided to\\ncamp for lunch. Mr. Evans\' eyes being very bad indeed, we are travelling\\nnow on our own, I am leading and telling him the course I am steering,\\nthat is the different marks on the mountains, but we shall keep on this\\nridge for some distance yet. After lunch to-day we did not proceed far\\nbefore we decided to camp, the surface being so bad and Mr. Evans\' eyes\\nso bad, we thought it would do us all good to have a rest. Last night we\\nleft a note for Capt. Scott, but did not say much about our difficulties\\njust above the Cloudmaker, as it would be better to tell him when we see\\nhim.\\n    _20th January 1912._\\nWe did not get away very smart to-day, but as we found the surface very\\nsoft, we decided to go on ski. Mr. Evans is still suffering with his eyes\\nand badly, after getting his ski on we tied him on to the trace so that\\nhe could help to drag a bit, when we were troubling about the ridges we\\ncame over on our outward Journey, but strange to say we never\\nencountered any ridges at all and the surface, although very soft, was\\nthe best I have ever sledged over ever since I have been at it. We\\nfancied on our left or to the west we saw what we took to be the ridges\\nwhat we seem to have missed altogether, although Mr. Evans have been\\nblind and could not see anything at all we have made splendid progress\\nand covered at least 20 miles, as near as we can guess. We passed to-day\\none of the Doctor\'s homeward bound camps, and kept on their track for\\nsome time, but finally lost it. We are camped to-night and we all feel\\nconfident we shall, if the weather remains good, reach the dep\xf4t\\nto-morrow night.\\n    _21st January 1912._","image":null},{"merge":"C13.04","output":"The passage describes a journey from Cloudmaker to the dep\xf4t.

We have now 360 miles to travel\\ngeographically to get to Hut Point. Mr. Evans complained to me while\\noutside the tent that he had a stiffness at the back of his legs behind\\nthe knees. I asked him what he thought it was, and he said could not\\naccount for it, so if he dont soon get rid of it I am to have a look and\\nsee if anything is the matter with him, as I know from what I have seen\\nand been told before the symptoms of scurvy is pains and swelling behind\\nthe knee round the ankle and loosening of the teeth, ulcerated gums.\\nTo-night I watched to see his gums, and I am convinced he is on the point\\nof something anyhow, and this I have spoken to Crean about, but he dont\\nseem to realise it. But I have asked him to wait developments for a time.\\nIt seems we are in for more trouble now, but lets hope for the best.\\n    _23rd January 1912._\\nWe got away pretty well and did a good journey, having covered about 14\\nmiles over a fairly good surface. We have passed the Blizzard Camp and\\nglad of it too, again to-day we saw in several places where the bridges\\non the crevasses had fallen through. A good job they none of them fell\\nthrough when we were going over them as the width would have taken all\\nthrough with them, and in every case where they had fallen through was\\nwhere we had gone over, as the mark of the sledge was very distinct in\\neach case.

We were\\non ski or we might have been on stilts for the amount of snow clogging on\\nour ski, dont know how we should have got on without our ski, as the snow\\nwas so very soft we sank right in when we tried to go on foot, but we\\nwere fortunate to get the wind behind us and able to make use of the\\nsail. We made a very good day of it, did 13 miles: 8 of this after lunch.\\nI did not feel well outside the tent this morning. I came over quite\\ngiddy and faint, but it passed off quickly and have felt no more of it\\nall day.\\n    _27th January 1912._\\nWe had a good run to-day with the sail up. It only required one of us to\\nkeep it straight, no need whatever to pull, but it was very hot, anyone\\ncould take off all their clothes and march. It is really too hot for this\\npart of the world, but I daresay we shall soon get it a bit colder. Did\\n14\xbd miles, it is nice to be able to see the tracks and cairns of our\\noutward journey. We feel satisfied when we have done a good day and in\\ngood time. Mr. Evans is now suffering from looseness of the bowels. Crean\\nhad a touch of it a few days ago, but he is quite alright again.\\n    _28th January 1912._\\nTo-day it have been a very heavy drag. The snow is still very soft and\\nthe sun very hot, it fairly scorches anyone\'s face. We are almost black\\nnow and our hair is long and getting white through being exposed to the\\nlight, it gets bleached. I am glad to say it is cooler to-night,\\ngenerally. We got over 12\xbd miles again to-day. Mr. Evans is still very\\nloose in his bowels. This, of course, hinders us, as we have had to stop\\nseveral times. Only another few more Sundays and we hope to be safely\\nhoused at Hut Point, or Cape Evans. We have now been out 97 days.\\n    _29th January 1912._\\nAnother good day was helped by the sail all day. One man could again\\nmanage for about two hours. The weather is still very warm, plus 20\\nagain. Did 16\xbd miles, only 14 to the next dep\xf4t. Mr. Evans is still\\nsuffering from the same complaint: have come to the conclusion to stop\\nhis pemmican, as I feel that it have got something to do with him being\\nout of sorts. Anyhow we are going to try it. Gave him a little brandy and\\nhe is taking some chalk and opium pills to try and stop it. His legs are\\ngetting worse and we are quite certain he is suffering from scurvy, at\\nleast he is turning black and blue and several other colours as well.\\n    _30th January 1912._\\nVery bad light but fair wind, picked up the dep\xf4t this evening. Did the\\n14 miles quite in good time, after taking our food we found a shortage of\\noil and have taken what we think will take us to the next dep\xf4t. There\\nseems to have been some leakage in the one can, but how we could not\\naccount for that we have left a note telling Capt. Scott how we found it,\\nbut they will have sufficient to carry them on to the next dep\xf4t, but we\\nall know the amount of oil allowed on the Journey is enough, but if any\\nwaste takes place it means extra precautions in the handling of it. Mr.\\nEvans is still without pemmican and seems to have somewhat recovered from\\nthe looseness, but things are not by a long way with him as they should\\nbe. Only two more dep\xf4ts now to pick up.\\n    _31st January 1912._\\nAnother very good run to-day but the light being very bad we had to\\ncontinually stop and steer by compass. This a difficult task, especially\\nas there was no wind to help keep on the course, but it have cleared\\nagain to-night, the temperature is plus 20 in the day and 10 at night\\njust now. Did 13 miles. Mr. Evans is allowed a little pemmican as the\\nwork is hard and it wants a little warm food to put life into anyone in\\nthis part of the world.\\n\\n    _1st February 1912._\\nWe had a very fine day but a very heavy pull, but we did 13 miles. Mr.\\nEvans and myself have been out 100 days to-day. I have had to change my\\nshirt again. This is the last clean side I have got. I have been wearing\\ntwo shirts and each side will now have done duty next the skin, as I have\\nchanged round each month, and I have certainly found the benefit of it,\\nand on the point we all three agree. Mr. Evans is still gradually worse:\\nit is no good closing our eyes to the fact. We must push on as we have a\\nlong way to go yet.\\n    _2nd February 1912._","image":null},{"merge":"C13.05","output":"Summary: The team is struggling on their way back from a journey to the south pole, and Mr. Evans is in severe pain.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"We have taken out our food and left nearly all the pemmican as we don\'t require it on account of none of us caring for it, therefore we are leaving it behind for the others.\\"\\nExcerpt 2: \\"He has got to do as we wish and we hope to pull him through.\\"\\n\\nText_to_image prompt: An image of a snow-covered landscape with two men pulling a sled loaded with gear and a third man strapped to the sled.

Mr. Evans is no better but seems to be in great\\npain, but he keeps quite cheerful we are pleased to say.\\n    _3rd February 1912._\\nThis morning we were forced to put Mr. Evans on his ski and strap him on,\\nas he could not lift his legs. I looked at them again and found they are\\nrapidly getting worse, things are looking serious on his part, but we\\nhave been trying to pump him up he will get through alright, but he\\nbegins to think different himself, but if we get to One Ton and can get a\\nchange of food it may relieve him. He is a brick, there is plenty of\\npluck: one cannot but admire such pluck. The light have been dreadful all\\nday and I seemed to have got a bit depressed at times, not being able to\\nsee anything to know where I was on the course or not and not getting a\\nword from Mr. Evans. I deliberately went off the course to see if anyone\\nwas taking notice but to my surprise I was quickly told I was off the\\ncourse. This I thought, but wanted to know if he was looking out, which\\nhe was. It came on to bliz after we camped, we ought to reach Mt. Hooper\\nto-morrow night.\\n    _4th February 1912._\\nStarted in splendid weather, but the surface was bad and dragging was\\nvery heavy, but it improved as the day went on, and we arrived at the\\ndep\xf4t at 7.40 P.M. We are now 180 miles from Hut Point, and this Sunday\\nnight we hope to be only two more Sundays on the Barrier. No improvement\\nin Mr. Evans, much worse. We have taken out our food and left nearly all\\nthe pemmican as we dont require it on account of none of us caring for\\nit, therefore we are leaving it behind for the others. They may require\\nit. We have left our note and wished them every success on their way, but\\nwe have decided it is best not to say anything about Mr. Evans being ill\\nor suffering from scurvy. This old cairn have stood the weather and is\\nstill a huge thing.\\n    _5th February 1912._\\nHad a very fine day and a good light all day, which makes things much\\nmore cheerful. Did not get away before 9 o\'clock but we did 11\xbd miles, it\\nis gradually getting colder. Mr. Evans is still getting worse, to-day he\\nis suffering from looseness in the bowels: shall have to stop his\\npemmican.\\n    _6th February 1912._\\nAnother fine day but sun was very hot and caused us to sweat a good deal,\\nbut we dont mind as we are pretty used to such changes. We shall soon be\\nlooking for land ahead, which will be Mt. Discovery or Mt. Erebus, we\\nhave 155 miles to go to Hut Point: done alright again 13\xbd miles, we do\\nwonderfully well especially as Mr. Evans have got to go very slowly first\\noff after stopping until he gets the stiffness out of his legs, but he is\\nsuffering a good deal and in silence, he never complains, but he dont get\\nmuch sleep. We shall all be glad when we arrive at One Ton, where there\\nis a change of food for us all. The pemmican is too much, especially when\\nthe weather is warm.\\n    _7th February 1912._\\nA very fine day but heavy going. We are bringing the land in sight. The\\nday have been simply lovely, did 12 miles. No better luck with our\\npatient, he gets along without a murmur. We have got to help him in and\\nout of the tent, but we have consulted on the matter and he is determined\\nto go to the last, which we know is not far off, as it is difficult for\\nhim to stand, but he is the essence of a brick to keep it up, but we\\nshall have to drag him on the sledge when he cant go any further.\\n    _8th February 1912._\\nTo-day have been very favourable and fine, we had a good breeze and set\\nsail after lunch. If we get a good day to-morrow we hope to reach One\\nTon. Mr. Evans have passed a good deal of blood to-day, which makes\\nthings look a lot worse. I have to do nearly everything for him now.\\n    _9th February 1912._\\nA very fine day and quite warm. Reached the dep\xf4t at 5.5 P.M. and we all\\nhad a good feed of oatmeal. Oh, what a God-send to get a change of food!\\nWe have taken enough food for 9 days, which if we still keep up our\\npresent rate of progress it ought to take us in to Hut Point. We cannot\\ntake too heavy a load, as there is only the two of us pulling now, and\\nthis our last port of call before we reach Hut Point, but things are not\\nlooking any too favourable for us, as our leader is gradually getting\\nlower every day. It is almost impossible for him to get along, and we\\nare still 120 miles from Hut Point.\\n    _10th February 1912._\\nWe did a good march, in very thick weather. To-night we are camped and I\\nam sorry to say Mr. Evans is in a very bad state. If this is scurvy I am\\nsorry for anyone it attacks. We shall do our utmost to get him back\\nalive, although he is so ill, he is very cheerful, which is very good and\\ntries to do anything to help us along. We are thinking the food, now we\\nhave got a change, may improve things. I am very pleased to say Crean and\\nmyself are in the best of health, which we are thankful for.\\n    _11th February 1912._\\nTo-day we built a cairn and left all our gear we could do without, as it\\nis impossible for us to drag the load now, and Mr. Evans we think is\\ndoing well as long as he can keep on his legs. We have had a very bad\\nlight all day, and to-night we have a bliz on us, so we had to camp\\nearly. Our day\'s run has been 11 miles. We are now about 99 miles from\\nour base.\\n    _12th February 1912._\\nWe did not get away until 10 o\'clock on account of bad weather, but after\\nwe put Mr. Evans on his ski he went on slowly. It is against our wish to\\nhave to send him on a little in advance, but it is best as we shall have\\nto drag him out of this we are certain. He has fainted on two or three\\noccasions, but after a drop of brandy he has been able to proceed, but it\\nis very awkward, especially as the temperature is so low. We are afraid\\nof his getting frost-bitten. Our progress is very slow, the light is very\\nbad, and it is seldom we see the land.\\n    _13th February 1912._\\nWe got away in good time, but progress was slow, and Mr. Evans could not\\ngo, and we consulted awhile and came to the conclusion it would be best\\nto put him on the sledge, otherwise he may not pull through, so we\\nstopped and camped, and decided to drop everything we can possibly do\\nwithout, so we have only got our sleeping bags, cooker, and what little\\nfood and oil we have left. Our load is not much, but Mr. Evans on the\\nsledge makes it pretty heavy work for us both, but he says he is\\ncomfortable now. This morning he wished us to leave him, but this we\\ncould not think of. We shall stand by him to the end one way or other, so\\nwe are the masters to-day. He has got to do as we wish and we hope to\\npull him through. This morning when we dep\xf4ted all our gear I changed my\\nsocks and got my foot badly frostbitten, and the only way was to fetch it\\nround. So although Mr. Evans was so bad he proposed to stuff it on his\\nstomach to try and get it right again. I did not like to risk such a\\nthing as he is certainly very weak, but we tried it, and it succeeded in\\nbringing it round, thanks to his thoughtfulness, and I shall never forget\\nthe kindness bestowed on me at a critical time in our travels, but I\\nthink we could go to any length of trouble to assist one another; in such\\ntime and such a place we must trust in a higher power to pull us through.\\nWhen we pack up now and have to move off we have to get everything ready\\nbefore we attempt to move the tent, as it is impossible for our leader\\nnow to stand, therefore it is necessary to get him ready before we start.\\nWe then pull the sledge alongside his bag and lift him on to it and strap\\nhim on. It is a painful piece of work and he takes it pretty well, but we\\ncan\'t help hurting him, as it is very awkward to lift him, the snow being\\nsoft and the light so bad, but he dont complain. The only thing we hear\\nhim grind his teeth.\\n    _14th February 1912._","image":null},{"merge":"C13.06","output":"(summary) The explorers face challenges as they travel towards Hut Point, including bad weather, low provisions, and the increasing weak condition of one of the team members.\\n \\n(excerpt_1) \\"Crean sailed away in splendid weather for a try to bring relief...but there was the possibility of his dropping down a crevasse.\\"\\n \\n(excerpt_2) \\"We have very little food now except biscuit, but oil is better...I have thought out a plan for the future, in case of no relief coming, but of course we took all things into consideration in case of failure, but we must hope for the best.\\"\\n \\n(text_to_image) A team of explorers huddle around their tent, bundled up against the cold weather.

It shows how deceiving the things here are. I\\ncan tell you our hopes were raised, but on reaching it they dropped again\\nconsiderably. We were able to see the land occasionally, and during one\\nof the breaks this afternoon we spotted the motor. Oh, what joy! We again\\nuncovered Mr. Evans to let him have a look and after trudging along for\\nanother three hours we brought up alongside it and camped for the night.\\nWe are now only a little over 30 miles from Hut Point: if we could only\\nsee the dogs approaching us, but they, we think, may have passed us while\\nthe weather have been thick. Mr. Evans is getting worse every day, we are\\nalmost afraid to sleep at night as he seems very weak. If the temperature\\ngoes much lower it will be a job to keep him warm. We have found some\\nbiscuits here at the motor but nothing else, but that will assist greatly\\non our way. The slogging have been heavy all day. We are pretty tired\\nto-night. I dont think we have got the go in us we had, but we must try\\nand push on.\\n    _18th February 1912._\\nI started to move Mr. Evans this morning, but he completely collapsed and\\nfainted away. Crean was very upset and almost cried, but I told him it\\nwas no good to create a scene but put up a bold front and try to assist.\\nI really think he thought Mr. Evans had gone, but we managed to pull him\\nthrough. We used the last drop of brandy. After awhile we got him on the\\nsledge and proceeded as usual, but finding the surface very bad and we\\nwere unable to make less than a mile an hour, we stopped and decided to\\ncamp. We told Mr. Evans of our plans, which were: Crean should proceed,\\nit being a splendid day, on foot to Hut Point to obtain relief if\\npossible. This we had agreed to between ourselves. I offered to do the\\nJourney and Crean remain behind, but Tom said he would much rather I\\nstayed with the invalid and look after him, so I thought it best I should\\nremain, and these plans were agreed to by all of us, so after we had\\ncamped the next thing was the food problem. We had about a day\'s\\nprovisions with extra biscuit taken from the motor, and a little extra\\noil taken from the same place, so we gave Crean what he thought he could\\nmanage to accomplish the Journey of 30 miles geographical on, which was a\\nlittle chocolate and biscuits. We put him up a little drink, but he would\\nnot carry it. What a pity we did not have some ski, but we dumped them to\\nsave weight. So Crean sailed away in splendid weather for a try to bring\\nrelief. I was in a bit of a sweat all day and remained up to watch the\\nweather till long after midnight. I was afraid of the weather, but it\\nkept clear and I thought he might have reached or got within easy\\ndistance of Hut Point; but there was the possibility of his dropping down\\na crevasse, but that we had to leave to chance, but none the more it was\\nanxious moments as if it comes on to drift the weather is very\\ntreacherous in these parts. After Crean left I left Mr. Evans and\\nproceeded to Corner Camp which was about a mile away, to see if there was\\nany provisions left there that would be of use to us. I found a little\\nbutter, a little cheese, and a little treacle that had been brought there\\nfor the ponies. I also went back to the motor and got a little more oil\\nwhile the weather was fine. I also got a large piece of burbery and tied\\non a long bamboo and stuck up a big flag on our sledge so that anyone\\ncould not pass our way without seeing us or our flag. I found a note left\\nat Corner Camp by Mr. Day saying there was a lot of very bad crevasses\\nbetween there and the sea ice, especially off White Island. This put me\\nin a bit of a fix, as I, of course, at once thought of Crean. He being on\\nfoot was more likely to go down than he would had he been on ski. I did\\nnot tell Mr. Evans anything about the crevasses, as I certainly thought\\nit would be best kept from him. I just told him the note was there and\\nall was well.\\n    _19th February 1912._\\nTo-day Mr. Evans seems a bit better and more cheerful, the rest will do\\nhim good and assist in getting a little strength. We have been wondering\\nwhen relief will reach us, but we cannot expect it for at least a day or\\ntwo yet at the earliest. It was very thick this morning and also very\\ncold. The temperature is dropping rapidly. Our tent was all covered in\\nfrost rime to-day, a sure sign of colder weather. It was very thick this\\nmorning but cleared as the day advanced, but we could not see Hut Point.\\nI wonder if poor old Tom reached alright. We have very little food now\\nexcept biscuit, but oil is better. We have got \xbd gallon and if relief\\ndont come for some time we shall be able to have hot water when all other\\nthings are gone. I have thought out a plan for the future, in case of no\\nrelief coming, but of course we took all things into consideration in\\ncase of failure, but we must hope for the best. Of course I know it is no\\nuse thinking of Mr. Evans being able to move any further as he cant stand\\nat all, the only thing is, we may have missed the dogs, if so there is\\nstill a chance of someone being at Hut Point. I am cold now and cannot\\nwrite more to-night. We lose the sun at midnight now.

Have had to remain in the tent all day to try and keep\\nwarm. Have not got much food except biscuits. Mr. Evans is about the same\\nbut quite cheerful. We have had whole journey over and over: it have\\npassed these three days away. We have wondered how they are getting on\\nbehind us; we have worked it out and they ought to be on the Barrier now,\\nwith anything of luck. We have been gambling on the condition of the ice\\nand the possibility of the open water at Hut Point at any time now, and\\nalso about what news of home, although home is one of the foremost\\nthoughts we hardly ever mention it, only what we are going to have to eat\\nwhen we do arrive there. I think we have got everything that is good down\\non our list. Of course New Zealand have got to be answerable for a good\\ndeal: plenty of apples we are going to have and some nice home-made cake,\\nnot too rich, as we think we can eat more. I wonder if the mules will\\nhave arrived, as I am to look after them till Capt. Oates returns, as\\nAnton will be gone home, or at least going soon. We shall have to hurry\\nup as the ship is to leave again on the 2nd of March, as it is not safe\\nto remain longer in these regions. I am now too cold to write, and I dont\\nseem settled at all and the weather is still pretty bad outside, so we\\nare not going to look for anything to come along to-night. \\"Hark!\\" from\\nus both. \\"Yes, it is the dogs near. Relief at last. Who is there?\\" I did\\nnot stay to think more before I was outside the tent. \\"Yes, sir, it is\\nalright.\\" The Doctor and Dimitri. \\"How did you see us?\\" \\"The flag Lash,\\"\\nsays Dimitri. The Doctor, \\"How is Mr. Evans?\\" \\"Alright, but low.\\" But\\nthis had a good effect on him. After the first few minutes we got their\\ntent pitched and the food they brought us I was soon on the way preparing\\na meal for us all, but Mr. Evans cannot have pemmican, but the Doctor\\nhave brought everything that will do him good, some onions to boil and\\nseveral other things. Dimitri brought along a good lump of cake: we are\\nin clover. To-night after the Doctor had examined my patient and we got\\nthrough a good deal of talk about everything we could think of,\\nespecially home news and the return parties and the ship and those in\\nher. We were sorry to hear she had not been able to get very near, and\\nthat the mules had arrived, and I dont know what, we now settled down for\\na good night. It seems to me we are in a new world, a weight is off my\\nmind and I can once more see a bright spot in the sky for us all, the\\ngloom is now removed. The bliz is bad outside, and Doctor and Dimitri is\\ngone and turned in, so will [I] once more, but sleep is out of the\\nquestion.\\n    _21st February 1912._\\nThe day have been very bad and we are obliged to remain until it clears.\\nWe are going to move off as soon as it clears, the day have been very\\ncold, so we have had to remain in our bags, but things are alright and we\\nhave got plenty to eat now. We have all retired for the night as the bliz\\nis still raging outside.\\n    _22nd February 1912._\\nThe wind went down about 9 P.M., so we began to move and were ready to\\nkick off at 10, and proposed to do the journey in two stages. It was\\nfearful heavy going for the poor dogs, we arranged so that Mr. Evans was\\non Dimitri\'s sledge and Doctor and myself was on the other. We have done\\nabout half the journey and are now camped for a rest for the dogs and\\nourselves. We had a stiff 16 miles: the Doctor and myself, we took turns\\nin riding on the sledge and walking and running to keep up to the dogs.\\nSometimes we sank in up to the knees, but we struggled through it. My\\nlegs is the most powerful part of me now, but I am tired and shall be\\nglad when it is over. I must lie down now, as we are starting again soon\\nfor Hut Point, but the surface is getting better as we have passed White\\nIsland and can see so plainly the land. Castle Rock and good old Erebus\\nlook so stately with the smoke rolling out. It is so clear and calm and\\npeaceful. What a change in our surroundings of a few days ago and also\\nour prospects. Doctor and Dimitri have done everything they could for us.\\n    _22nd February 1912._\\nWe started off after a rest for the dogs and reached here at Hut Point at\\n1 P.M. where we can rest in peace for a time. Dimitri and Crean are going\\nto Cape Evans: the ship is nowhere in sight. Have had to get some seal\\nmeat and ice and prepare a meal. Mr. Evans is alright and asleep. We are\\nlooking for a mail now. How funny we should always be looking for\\nsomething else, now we are safe.\\n[End of Lashly\'s Diary.]\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nCrean has told me the story of his walk as follows:\\nHe started at 10 on Sunday morning and \\"the surface was good, very good\\nsurface indeed,\\" and he went about sixteen miles before he stopped. Good\\nclear weather. He had three biscuits and two sticks of chocolate. He\\nstopped about five minutes, sitting on the snow, and ate two biscuits and\\nthe chocolate, and put one biscuit back in his pocket. He was quite warm\\nand not sleepy.\\nHe carried on just the same and passed Safety Camp on his right some five\\nhours later, and thinks it was about twelve-thirty on Monday morning that\\nhe reached the edge of the Barrier, tired, getting cold in the back and\\nthe weather coming on thick. It was bright behind him but it was coming\\nover the Bluff, and White Island was obscured though he could still see\\nCape Armitage and Castle Rock. He slipped a lot on the sea-ice, having\\nseveral falls on to his back and it was getting thicker all the time. At\\nthe Barrier edge there was a light wind, now it was blowing a strong\\nwind, drifting and snowing. He made for the Gap and could not get up at\\nfirst. To avoid taking a lot out of himself he started to go round Cape\\nArmitage; but soon felt slush coming through his finnesko (he had no\\ncrampons) and made back for the Gap. He climbed up to the left of the Gap\\nand climbed along the side of Observation Hill to avoid the slippery ice.\\nWhen he got to the top it was still clear enough to see vaguely the\\noutline of Hut Point, but he could see no sledges nor dogs. He sat down\\nunder the lee of Observation Hill, and finished his biscuit with a bit of\\nice: \\"I was very dry,\\"--slid down the side of Observation Hill and\\nthought at this time there was open water below, for he had no goggles on\\nthe march and his eyes were strained. But on getting near the ice-foot he\\nfound it was polished sea-ice and made his way round to the hut under the\\nice-foot. When he got close he saw the dogs and sledges on the sea-ice,\\nand it was now blowing very hard with drift. He walked in and found the\\nDoctor and Dimitri inside. \\"He gave me a tot first, and then a feed of\\nporridge--but I couldn\'t keep it down: thats the first time in my life\\nthat ever it happened, and it was the brandy that did it.\\"\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [253] See pp. 382, 383, 410, 412.\\n   [254] My own diary, December 22, 1911.\\n   [255] My own diary.\\n   [256] My own diary.\\n   [257] See p. 412.\\n   [258] See p. 335.\\n\\n\\n","image":null},{"merge":"C14.01","output":"The passage describes the return of the supporting party to Cape Evans, the arrival of the Terra Nova, and the addition of mules and dogs to the expedition.

O pioneers!\\n    WALT WHITMAN.\\n\\nLet us come back to Cape Evans after the return of the First Supporting\\nParty.\\nHitherto our ways had always been happy: for the most part they had been\\npleasant. Scott was going to reach the Pole, probably without great\\ndifficulty, for when we left him on the edge of the plateau he had only\\nto average seven miles a day to go there on full rations. We ourselves\\nhad averaged 14.2 geographical miles a day on our way home to One Ton\\nDep\xf4t, and there seemed no reason to suppose that the other two parties\\nwould not do likewise, and the food was not only sufficient but abundant\\nif such marches were made. Thus we were content as we wandered over the\\ncape, or sat upon some rock warmed by the sun and watched the penguins\\nbathing in the lake which had formed in the sea-ice between us and\\nInaccessible Island. All round us were the cries of the skua gulls as\\nthey squabbled among themselves, and we heard the swish of their wings as\\nthey swooped down upon a man who wandered too near their nests. Out upon\\nthe sea-ice, which was soggy and dangerous, lay several seal, and the\\nbubblings and whistlings and gurglings which came from their throats\\nchimed musically in contrast to the hoarse aak, aak, of the Ad\xe9lie\\npenguins: the tide crack was sighing and groaning all the time: it was\\nvery restful after the Barrier silence.\\nMeanwhile the Terra Nova had been seen in the distance, but the state of\\nthe sea-ice prevented her approach. It was not until February 4 that\\ncommunication was opened with her and we got our welcome mails and news\\nof the world during the last year. We heard that Campbell\'s party had\\nbeen picked up at Cape Adare and landed at Evans Coves. We started\\nunloading on February 9, and this work was continued until February 14:\\nthere was about three miles of ice between the ship and the shore and we\\nwere doing more than twenty miles a day. In the case of men who had been\\nsledging much, and who might be wanted to sledge again, this was a\\nmistake. Latterly the ice began to break up, and the ship left on the\\n15th, to pick up the Geological Party on the western side of McMurdo\\nSound. But she met great obstacles, and her record near the coasts this\\nyear is one of continual fights against pack-ice, while the winds\\nexperienced as the season advanced were very strong. On January 13 the\\nfast ice at the mouth of McMurdo Sound extended as far as the southern\\nend of the Bird Peninsula: ten days later they found fast ice extending\\nfor thirty miles from the head of Granite Harbour. Later in the season\\nthe most determined efforts were made again and again to penetrate into\\nEvans Coves in order to pick up Campbell and his men, until the ice was\\nfreezing all round them, and many times the propeller was brought up dead\\nagainst blocks of ice.[259]\\nThe expedition was originally formed for two years from the date of\\nleaving England. But before the ship left after landing us at Cape Evans\\nin January 1911 the possibility of a third year was considered, and\\ncertain requests for additional transport and orders for stores were sent\\nhome. Thus it came about that the ship now landed not only new sledges\\nand sledging stores but also fourteen dogs from Kamchatka and seven\\nmules, with their food and equipment. The dogs were big and fat, but the\\nonly ones which proved of much service for sledging were Snowy, a nice\\nwhite dog, and Bullett. It was Oates\' idea that mules might prove a\\nbetter form of transport on the Barrier than ponies. Scott therefore\\nwrote to Sir Douglas Haig, then C.-in-C. in India, that if he failed to\\nreach the Pole in the summer of 1911-12, \\"it is my intention to make a\\nsecond attempt in the following season provided fresh transport can be\\nbrought down: the circumstances making it necessary to plan to sacrifice\\nthe transport animals used in any attempt.\\n\\"Before directing more ponies to be sent down I have thoroughly discussed\\nthe situation with Captain Oates, and he has suggested that mules would\\nbe better than ponies for our work and that trained Indian Transport\\nMules would be ideal. It is evident already that our ponies have not a\\nuniform walking pace and that in other small ways they will be\\ntroublesome to us although they are handy little beasts.\\"\\nThe Indian Government not only sent seven mules but when they arrived we\\nfound that they had been most carefully trained and equipped. In India\\nthey were in the charge of Lieutenant George Pulleyn, and the care and\\nthought which had been spent upon them could not have been exceeded: the\\nequipment was also extremely good and well adapted to the conditions,\\nwhile most of the improvements made by us as the result of a year\'s\\nexperience were already foreseen and provided. The mules themselves, by\\nname Lal Khan, Gulab, Begum, Ranee, Abdullah, Pyaree and Khan Sahib, were\\nbeautiful animals.\\nAtkinson would soon have to start on his travels again. Before we left\\nScott at the top of the Beardmore he gave him orders to take the two\\ndog-teams South in the event of Meares having to return home, as seemed\\nlikely. This was not meant in any way to be a relief journey. Scott said\\nthat he was not relying upon the dogs; and that in view of the sledging\\nin the following year, the dogs were not to be risked. Although it was\\nsettled that some members of the expedition would stay, while others\\nreturned to New Zealand, Scott and several of his companions had left\\nundecided until the last moment the question of whether they would\\nthemselves remain in the South for another year. In the event of Scott\\ndeciding to return home the dog-teams might make the difference between\\ncatching or missing the ship. I had discussed this question with Wilson\\nmore than once, and he was of opinion that the business affairs of the\\nexpedition demanded Scott\'s return if possible: Wilson himself inclined\\nto the view that he himself would stay if Scott stayed, and return if\\nScott returned. I think that Oates meant to return, and am sure that\\nBowers meant to stay: indeed he welcomed the idea of one more year in a\\nway which I do not think was equalled by any other member of the\\nexpedition. For the most part we felt that we had joined up for two\\nyears, but that if there was to be a third year we would rather see the\\nthing through than return home.\\nI hope I have made clear that the primary object of this journey with the\\ndog-teams was to hurry Scott and his companions home so that they might\\nbe in time to catch the ship if possible, before she was compelled by the\\nclose of the season to leave McMurdo Sound. Another thing which made\\nScott anxious to communicate with the ship if possible before the season\\nforced her to leave the Sound was his desire to send back news. From many\\nremarks which he made, and also from the discussions in the hut during\\nthe winter, it was obvious that he considered it was of the first\\nimportance that the news of reaching the Pole, if it should be reached,\\nbe communicated to the world without the delay of another year. Of course\\nhe would also wish to send news of the safe return of his party to wives\\nand relations as soon as possible. It is necessary to emphasize the fact\\nthat the dog-teams were intended to hasten the return of the Polar Party,\\nbut that they were never meant to form a relief journey.\\nBut now Atkinson was left in a rather difficult position. I note in my\\ndiary, after we had reached the hut, that \\"Scott was to have sent back\\ninstructions for the dog party with us, but these have, it would seem,\\nbeen forgotten\\"; but it may be that Scott considered that he had given\\nthese instructions in a conversation he had with Atkinson at the top of\\nthe Beardmore Glacier, when Scott said, \\"with the dep\xf4t [of dog-food]\\nwhich has been laid come as far as you can.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C14.02","output":"The passage describes the difficulty of estimating when a party will reach a given point after an uncertain journey in uncertain weather conditions, as well as the challenge of maintaining food supplies and the health of team members during long journeys on the polar plateau.

It was also arranged that if possible a dep\xf4t of dog-biscuit\\nshould be taken out at the same time: this was the dep\xf4t referred to\\nabove by Scott. In the event of the return of the dog-teams in the first\\nhalf of December, which was the original plan, the five units of food and\\nthe dog-biscuit would have been run out by them to One Ton. If the\\ndog-teams did not return in time to do this a man-hauling party from Cape\\nEvans was to take out three of the five units of food.\\nIt has been shown that the dog-teams were taken farther on the Polar\\nJourney than was originally intended,[260] indeed they were taken from\\n81\xb0 15\xb4, where they were to have turned back, as far as 83\xb0 35\xb4. Nor were\\nthey able to make the return journey in the fast time which had been\\nexpected of them, and the dog-drivers were running very short of food and\\nwere compelled to encroach to some extent upon the supplies left to\\nprovide for the wants of those who were following in their tracks.[261]\\nThe dog-teams did not arrive back at Cape Evans until January 4.\\nMeanwhile a man-hauling party from Cape Evans, consisting of Day, Nelson,\\nClissold and Hooper, had already, according to plan, taken out three of\\nthe five XS rations for the returning parties. The weights of the\\nman-hauling party did not allow for the transport of the remaining two XS\\nrations, nor for any of the dog-food. Thus it was that when Atkinson came\\nto make his plans to go South with the dogs he found that there was no\\ndog-food south of Corner Camp, and that the rations for the return of the\\nPolar Party from One Ton Dep\xf4t had still to be taken out. That is to say,\\nthe dep\xf4t of dog-food spoken of by Scott did not exist. There was,\\nhowever, enough food already at One Ton to allow the Polar Party to come\\nin on reduced rations. This meant that what the dog-teams could do was\\nlimited, and was much less than it might have been had it been possible\\nto take out the dep\xf4t of dog-food to One Ton. Also the man-food for the\\nPolar Party had to be added to the weights taken by the dogs.\\nTo estimate even approximately at what date a party will reach a given\\npoint after a journey of this length when the weather conditions are\\nalways uncertain and the number of travelling days unknown, was a most\\ndifficult task. The only guide was the average marches per diem made by\\nour own return party, and the average of the second return party if it\\nshould return before the dog party set out. A week one way or the other\\nwas certainly not a large margin. A couple of blizzards might make this\\nmuch difference.\\nIn the plan of the Southern Journey Scott, working on Shackleton\'s\\naverages, mentions March 27 as a possible date of return to Hut Point,\\nallowing seven days in from One Ton. Whilst on the outward journey I\\nheard Scott discuss the possibility of returning in April; and the Polar\\nParty had enough food to allow them to do this on full rations.\\nAtkinson and Dimitri with the two dog-teams left Cape Evans for Hut Point\\non February 13 because the sea-ice, which was our only means of\\ncommunication between these places, and so to the Barrier, was beginning\\nto break up. Atkinson intended to leave Hut Point for the Barrier in\\nabout a week\'s time. At 3.30 A.M. on February 19 Crean arrived with the\\nastounding news that Lieutenant Evans, still alive but at his last gasp,\\nwas lying out near Corner Camp, and that Lashly was nursing him; that the\\nLast Supporting Party had consisted of three men only, a possibility\\nwhich had never been considered; and that they had left Scott,\\ntravelling rapidly and making good averages, only 148 geographical miles\\nfrom the Pole. Scott was so well advanced that it seemed that he would be\\nhome much earlier than had been anticipated.\\nA blizzard which had been threatening on the Barrier, and actually\\nblowing at Hut Point, during Crean\'s solitary journey, but which had\\nlulled as he arrived, now broke with full force, and nothing could be\\ndone for Evans until it took off sufficiently for the dog-teams to\\ntravel. But in the meantime Crean urgently wanted food and rest and\\nwarmth. As these were supplied to him Atkinson learned bit by bit the\\nstory of the saving of Evans\' life, told so graphically in Lashly\'s diary\\nwhich is given in the preceding chapter, and pieced together the details\\nof Crean\'s solitary walk of thirty-five statute miles. This effort was\\nmade, it should be remembered, at the end of a journey of three and a\\nhalf months, and over ground rendered especially perilous by crevasses,\\nfrom which a man travelling alone had no chance of rescue in case of\\naccident. Crean was walking for eighteen hours, and it was lucky for him,\\nas also for his companions, that the blizzard which broke half an hour\\nafter his arrival did not come a little sooner, for no power on earth\\ncould have saved him then, and the news of Evans\' plight would not have\\nbeen brought.\\nThe blizzard raged all that day, and the next night and morning, and\\nnothing could be done. But during the afternoon of the 20th the\\nconditions improved, and at 4.30 P.M. Atkinson and Dimitri started with\\nthe two dog-teams, though it was still blowing hard and very thick. They\\ntravelled, with one rest for the dogs, until 4.30 P.M. the next day, but\\nhad a very hazy idea where they were most of the time, owing to the vile\\nweather: once at any rate they seem to have got right in under White\\nIsland. When they camped the second time they thought they were in the\\nneighbourhood of Lashly\'s tent, and in a temporary clearance they saw the\\nflag which Lashly had put up on the sledge. Evans was still alive, and\\nAtkinson was able to give him immediately the fresh vegetables, fruit,\\nand seal meat which his body wanted. Atkinson has never been able to\\nexpress adequately the admiration he feels for Lashly\'s care and\\nnursing.\\nAll that night and the next day the blizzard continued and made a start\\nimpossible, and it was not until 3 A.M. on the morning of the 22nd that\\nthey could start for Hut Point, Evans being carried in his sleeping-bag\\non the sledge. Lashly has told how they got home.\\nAt Cape Evans we knew nothing of these events, which had made\\nreorganization inevitable. It was clear that Atkinson, being the only\\ndoctor available, would have to stay with Evans, who was very seriously\\nill: indeed Atkinson told me that another day, or at the most two, would\\nhave finished him. In fact he says that when he first saw him he thought\\nhe must die. It was a considerable surprise then when Dimitri with Crean\\nand one dog-team reached Cape Evans about mid-day on February 23 with a\\nnote from Atkinson, who said that he thought he had better stay with\\nLieutenant Evans and that some one else should take out the dogs. He\\nsuggested that Wright or myself should take them. This was our first\\nintimation that the dogs had not already gone South.\\nWright and I started for Hut Point by 2 P.M. the same day and on our\\narrival it was decided by Atkinson that I was to take out the dogs. Owing\\nto the early departure of our meteorologist, Simpson, Wright, who had\\nspecial qualifications for this important work, was to remain at Cape\\nEvans. Dimitri having rested his dog-team overnight at Cape Evans arrived\\nat Hut Point on the morning of the 24th.\\nNow the daily distance which every 4-man party had to average from Hut\\nPoint to its turning-point and back to Hut Point, so as to be on full\\nrations all the way, was only 8.4 geographical miles. From Hut Point to\\nthe latitude in which he was last seen, 87\xb0 32\xb4 S., Scott had averaged\\nmore than ten geographical miles a day.\\nTaking into consideration the advanced latitude, 87\xb0 32\xb4 S., at which the\\nSecond Return Party had left Scott, and the extremely good daily averages\\nthese two parties had marched on the plateau up to this point, namely\\n12.3 geographical miles a day; seeing also that the First Return Party\\nhad averaged 14.2 geographical miles on their return from 85\xb0 3\xb4 S. to\\nOne Ton Dep\xf4t; and the Second Return Party had averaged 11.2 geographical\\nmiles on their return from 87\xb0 32\xb4 S. to the same place, although one of\\nthe three men was seriously ill; it was supposed that all the previous\\nestimates made for the return of the Polar Party were too late, and that\\nthe opportunity to reach One Ton Camp before them had been lost.\\nMeanwhile the full rations for their return over the 140 miles (statute)\\nfrom One Ton to Hut Point were still at Hut Point.\\nMy orders were given me by Atkinson, and were verbal, as follows:\\n    1. To take 24 days\' food for the two men, and 21\\n    days\' food for the two dog-teams, together with the food\\n    for the Polar Party.\\n    2.

But we got along very well, Dimitri driving his team in\\nfront, as he did most of this journey, and picking up marks very\\nhelpfully with his sharp eyes. In the low temperatures we met, the\\nglasses which I must wear are almost impossible, because of fogging. We\\ntook three boxes of dog-biscuit from Safety Camp and another three boxes\\nfrom a point sixteen miles from Hut Point. Here we rested the dogs for a\\nfew hours, and started again at 6 P.M. All day the light was appalling,\\nand the wind strong, but to my great relief we found Corner Camp after\\nfour hours\' more travelling, the flag showing plainly, though the cairn\\nitself was invisible when a hundred yards away. This was the last place\\nwhere there was any dog-food on the route, and the dogs got a good feed\\nafter doing thirty-four miles (statute) for the day\'s run. This was more\\nthan we had hoped: the only disquieting fact was that both the\\nsledge-meters which we had were working wrong: the better of the two\\nseemed however to be marking the total mileage fairly correctly at\\npresent, though the hands which indicated more detailed information were\\nquite at sea.

I\\nmissed the driving-stick but got on to the sledge with no hope of\\nstopping them, and I was carried a mile to the south, leaving four boxes\\nof dog-food, the weekly bag, cooker, and tent poles on the ground.

The question of what we were to do in the\\nimmediate future was settled for us; for four days out of the six during\\nwhich we were at One Ton the weather made travelling southwards, that is\\nagainst the wind, either entirely impossible or such that the chance of\\nseeing another party at any distance was nil. On the two remaining days I\\ncould have run a day farther South and back again, with the possibility\\nof missing the party on the way.

Dimitri had long experience of dog-driving\\nand I had none. I thought and I still think he was right. I increased the\\ndog ration therefore, and this left us with thirteen more days\' dog-food,\\nincluding that for March 4.\\nThe weather was bad when we were at One Ton, for when it was blowing the\\ntemperature often remained comparatively low, and when it was not blowing\\nit dropped considerably, and I find readings in my diary of -34\xb0 and -37\xb0\\nat 8 P.M.

On the other hand I find an entry: \\"To-day is the first\\nreal good one we have had, only about -10\xb0 and the sun shining,--and we\\nhave shifted the tent, dried our bags and gear a lot, and been pottering\\nabout all day.\\" At this time, however, when we were at One Ton I looked\\nupon these conditions as being a temporary cold snap: there was no reason\\nthen to suppose these were normal March conditions in the middle of the\\nBarrier, where no one had ever been at this time of year. I believe now\\nthey are normal: on the other hand, in our meteorological report Simpson\\nargues that they were abnormal for the Barrier at this time of year.[264]\\nSince there was no dep\xf4t of dog-food at One Ton it was not possible to go\\nfarther South (except for the one day mentioned above) without killing\\ndogs. My orders on this point were perfectly explicit; I saw no reason\\nfor disobeying them, and indeed it appeared that we had been wrong to\\nhurry out so soon, before the time that Scott had reckoned that he would\\nreturn, and that the Polar Party would really come in at the time Scott\\nhad calculated before starting rather than at the time we had reckoned\\nfrom the data brought back by the Last Return Party.","image":null},{"merge":"C14.04","output":"{\\n    \\"summary\\": \\"The author had no reason to believe that the Polar Party would be in need of food.

The Polar Party\\nof five men had according to our rations plenty of food either on their\\nsledge or in the dep\xf4ts. In addition they had a lot of pony meat dep\xf4ted\\nat Middle Glacier Dep\xf4t and onwards from there. Though we did not know\\nit, the death of Evans at the foot of the Beardmore Glacier provided an\\nadditional amount of food for the four men who were then left. The full\\namount of oil for this food had been left in the dep\xf4ts; but we know now\\nwhat we did not know then, that some of it had evaporated. These matters\\nare discussed in greater detail in the account of the return of the Polar\\nParty and after.[265]\\nThus I felt little anxiety for the Polar Party. But I was getting anxious\\nabout my companion. Soon after arrival at One Ton it was clear that\\nDimitri was feeling the cold. He complained of his head; then his right\\narm and side were affected; and from this time onwards he found that he\\ncould do less and less with his right side. Still I did not worry much\\nabout it, and my decision as to our movements was not affected by this\\ncomplication. I decided to allow eight days\' food for our return, which\\nmeant that we must start on March 10.\\n\\"_March 10._ Pretty cold night: -33\xb0 when we turned out at 8 A.M.\\nGetting our gear together, and the dogs more or less into order after\\ntheir six days was cold work, and we started in minus thirties and a head\\nwind. The dogs were mad,--stark, staring lunatics. Dimitri\'s team wrecked\\nmy sledge-meter, and I left it lying on the ground a mile from One Ton.\\nAll we could do was to hang on to the sledge and let them go: there\\nwasn\'t a chance to go back, turn them or steer them. Dimitri broke his\\ndriving-stick: my team fought as they went: once I was dragged with my\\nfoot pinned under my driving-stick, which was itself jammed in the\\ngrummet: several times I only managed to catch on anywhere: this went on\\nfor six or seven miles, and then they got better.\\"[266]\\nOur remaining sledge-meter was quite unreliable, but following our\\noutward tracks (for it became thick and overcast), and judging by our old\\ncamping sites, we reckoned that we had done an excellent run of 23 to 24\\nmiles (statute) for the day. The temperature when we camped was only\\n-14\xb0. However it became much colder in the night, and when we turned out\\nit was so thick that I decided we must wait. At 2 P.M. on March 11 there\\nwas one small patch of blue sky showing, and we started to steer by this:\\nsoon it was blowing a mild blizzard, and we stopped after doing what I\\nreckoned was eight miles, steering by trying to keep the wind on my ear:\\nbut I think we were turning circles much of the time. It blew hard and\\nwas very cold during the night, and we turned out on the morning of March\\n12 to a blizzard with a temperature of -33\xb0: this gradually took off, and\\nat 10 A.M. Dimitri said he could see the Bluff, and we were right into\\nthe land, and therefore the pressure. This was startling, but later it\\ncleared enough to reassure me, though Dimitri was so certain that during\\nthe first part of our run that day I steered east a lot. We did 25 to 30\\nmiles this day in drift and a temperature of -28\xb0.\\nBy now I was becoming really alarmed and anxious about Dimitri, who\\nseemed to be getting much worse, and to be able to do less and less.\\nSitting on a sledge the next day with a head wind and the temperature\\n-30\xb0 was cold. The land was clear when we turned out and I could see that\\nwe must be far outside our course, but almost immediately it became\\nfoggy. We made in towards the land a good deal, and made a good run, but\\nowing to the sledge-meter being useless and the bad weather generally\\nduring the last few days, I had a very hazy idea indeed where we were\\nwhen we camped, having been steering for some time by the faint gleam of\\nthe sun through the mist. Just after camping Dimitri suddenly pointed to\\na black spot which seemed to wave to and fro: we decided that it was the\\nflag of the derelict motor near Corner Camp which up to that time I\\nthought was ten to fifteen miles away: this was a great relief, and we\\ndebated packing up again and going to it, but decided to stay where we\\nwere.\\nIt was fairly clear on the morning of March 14, which was lucky, for it\\nwas now obvious that we were miles from Corner Camp and much too near the\\nland. The flag we had seen must have been a miraged piece of pressure,\\nand it was providential that we had not made for it, and found worse\\ntrouble than we actually experienced. Try all I could that morning, my\\nteam, which was leading, insisted on edging westwards. At last I saw what\\nI thought was a cairn, but found out just in time that it was a haycock\\nor mound of ice formed by pressure: by its side was a large open\\ncrevasse, of which about fifty yards of snow-bridge had fallen in. For\\nseveral miles we knew that we were crossing big crevasses by the hollow\\nsound, and it was with considerable relief that I sighted the motor and\\nthen Corner Camp some two or three miles to the east of us. \\"Dimitri had\\nleft his Alpine rope there, and also I should have liked to have brought\\nin Evans\' sledge, but it would have meant about five miles extra, and I\\nleft it. I hope Scott, finding no note, will not think we are lost.\\"[267]\\nDimitri seemed to be getting worse, and we pushed on until we camped that\\nnight only fifteen miles from Hut Point. My main anxiety was whether the\\nsea-ice between us and Hut Point was in, because I felt that the job of\\ngetting the teams up on to the Peninsula and along it and down the other\\nside would be almost more than we could do: there was an ominous\\nopen-water sky ahead.\\nOn March 15 we were held up all day by a strong blizzard. But by 8 A.M.\\nthe next morning we could see just the outline of White Island. I was\\nvery anxious, for Dimitri said that he had nearly fainted, and I felt\\nthat we must get on somehow, and chance the sea-ice being in. He stayed\\ninside the tent as long as possible, and my spirits rose as the land\\nbegan to clear all round while I was packing up both sledges. From Safety\\nCamp the mirage at the edge of the Barrier was alarming, but as we\\napproached the edge to my very great relief I found that the sea-ice was\\nstill in, and that what we had taken for frost smoke was only drift over\\nCape Armitage.\\nPushing into the drift round the corner I found Atkinson on the sea-ice,\\nand Keohane in the hut behind. In a few minutes we had the gist of one\\nanother\'s news. The ship had made attempt after attempt to reach Campbell\\nand his five men, but they had not been taken off from Evans Coves when\\nshe finally left McMurdo Sound on March 4: she would make another effort\\non her way to New Zealand. Evans was better and was being taken home.\\nMeanwhile there were four of us at Hut Point and we could not communicate\\nwith our companions at Cape Evans until the Sound froze over, for the\\nopen sea was washing the feet of Vince\'s Cross.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nWe were not unduly alarmed about the Polar Party at present, but began to\\nmake arrangements for further sledging if necessary. It was useless to\\nthink of taking the dogs again for they were thoroughly done. The mules\\nand the new dogs were at Cape Evans. \\"In four or five days Atkinson\\nwishes to start South again to see what we can do man-hauling, if the\\nPolar Party is not in. I agree with him that to try and go west to meet\\nCampbell is useless just now. If we can go north, they can come south,\\nand to put two parties there on the new sea-ice is to double the risk.\\"\\n\\"_March 17._ A blizzard day but only about force 5-6. I think they will\\nhave been able to travel all right on the Barrier. Atkinson thinks of\\nstarting on the 22nd: my view is that allowing three weeks and four days\\nfor the Summit, and ten days for being hung up by weather, we can give\\nthem five weeks after the Last Return Party (i.e. to March 26) to get\\nin, having been quite safe and sound all the way. We feel anxious now,\\nbut I do not think there is need for alarm till then, and they might get\\nin well after that, and be all right.\\n\\"Now our only real chance of finding them, if we go out, is from here to\\nten miles south of Corner Camp. After that we shall do all we can, but it\\nwould be no good, because there is no very definite route. Therefore I\\nwould start out on March 27, when we would travel that part with most\\nchance of meeting them there if they have any trouble. I have put this to\\nAtkinson and will willingly do what he decides. I am feeling pretty done\\nup, and have rested. The prospect of what will be a hard journey, feeling\\nas I do, is rather bad. I don\'t think there is really cause for alarm.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C14.05","output":"The author\'s health is deteriorating, and he is doubtful about being able to venture out again; a blizzard traps them inside the hut, causing temporary injury to the author; Atkinson goes out on the Barrier with Keohane but makes the decision to turn back due to low temperatures and hopeless chances of finding the Pole Party.

We were\\ncheered by the noise. But no party arrived, and the singing of the dogs\\nwas explained later by some seal appearing on the new ice in Arrival Bay.\\nAtkinson decided to go out on to the Barrier man-hauling with Keohane on\\nthe 26th. It was obvious that I could not go with them: he told me\\nafterwards that when I came in with the dog-teams he was sure I could not\\ngo out again.\\n\\"_March 25._ The wind came away yesterday evening, first S.W. and then\\nS.E. but not bad, though very thick. It was a surprise to find we could\\nsee the Western Mountains this morning, and I believe it has been a good\\nday on the Barrier, though it is still blowing with low drift this\\nevening. We are now on the days when I expect the Polar Party in: pray\\nGod I may be right. Atkinson and I look at one another, and he looks, and\\nI feel, quite haggard with anxiety. He says he does not think they have\\nscurvy. We both, I think, feel quite comfortable, in comparison, about\\nCampbell: he only wants to exercise care, and his great care was almost a\\nbyword on the ship. They are fresh and they have plenty of seal.[269] He\\ndiscussed with Pennell both the possibility of shipwreck and that of the\\nship being unable to get to him, and for this reason landed an extra\\nmonth\'s rations as a dep\xf4t; also he contemplated the idea of living on\\nseal. He knows of the Butter Point Dep\xf4t, and knows that a party has been\\nsledging in that neighbourhood: though he does not know of the dep\xf4ts\\nthey left at Cape Roberts and Cape Bernacchi, they are right out on the\\nPoints and Taylor says he could not miss them on his way down the\\ncoast.\\"[270]\\nThis day Atkinson thought he saw Campbell\'s party coming in, and the next\\nday Keohane and Dimitri came in great excitement and said they could see\\nthem, and we were out on the Point and on the sea-ice in the drift for\\nquite a long time. \\"Last night we had turned in about two hours when five\\nor six knocks were hit on the little window over our heads. Atkinson\\nshouted \'Hullo!\' and cried, \'Cherry, they\'re in.\' Keohane said, \'Who\'s\\ncook?\' Some one lit a candle and left it in the far corner of the hut to\\ngive them light, and we all rushed out. But there was no one there. It\\nwas the nearest approach to ghost work that I have ever heard, and it\\nmust have been a dog which sleeps in that window. He must have shaken\\nhimself, hitting the window with his tail. Atkinson thought he heard\\nfootsteps!\\"[271]\\nOn Wednesday, March 27, Atkinson started out on to the Barrier with one\\ncompanion, Keohane. During the whole of this trip the temperatures were\\nlow, and both men obtained but little sleep, finding of course that a\\ntent occupied by two men only is a very cold place. The first two days\\nthey made nine miles each day, on March 29 they pushed on in thick\\nweather for eleven miles, when the weather cleared enough to show them\\nthat they had got into the White Island pressure. On March 30 they\\nreached a point south of Corner Camp, when \\"taking into consideration the\\nweather, and temperatures, and the time of the year, and the hopelessness\\nof finding the party except at any definite point like a dep\xf4t, I decided\\nto return from here. We dep\xf4ted the major portion of a week\'s provisions\\nto enable them to communicate with Hut Point in case they should reach\\nthis point. At this date in my own mind I was morally certain that the\\nparty had perished, and in fact on March 29 Captain Scott, 11 miles south\\nof One Ton Dep\xf4t, made the last entry in his diary.\\"[272]\\n\\"They arrived back on April 1. Yesterday evening at 6.30 P.M. Atkinson\\nand Keohane arrived. It was pretty thick here and blowing too, but they\\nhad had a fair day on the Barrier. They had been out to Corner Camp and\\neight miles farther. Their bags were bad, their clothes very bad after\\nsix days: they must have had minus forties constantly. It is a moral\\ncertainty that to go farther south would serve no purpose, and for two\\nmen would be a useless risk. They did quite right to come back. They are\\nmuch in want of sleep, poor devils, and I do hope Atkinson will allow\\nhimself to rest: he looks as though he might knock up. Keohane did well,\\nand is very fit. They came in over fifteen miles yesterday, and have\\nbrought in the sledge of the Second Return Party, the one they took out\\nbeing very heavy pulling. They had no day on which they could not travel.\\nHere it has been blowing and drifting half the time he has been absent,\\"\\nand a few days later, \\"We have got to face it now. The Pole Party will\\nnot in all probability ever get back. And there is no more that we can\\ndo. The next step must be to get to Cape Evans as soon as it is possible.\\nThere are fresh men there: at any rate fresh compared to us.\\"[273]\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nAtkinson was the senior officer left, and unless Campbell and his party\\ncame in, the command of the Main Party devolved upon him. It was not a\\nposition which any one could envy even if he had been fresh and fit.\\nAmidst all his anxieties and responsibilities he looked after me with the\\ngreatest patience and care. I was so weak that sometimes I could only\\nkeep on my legs with difficulty: the glands of my throat were swollen so\\nthat I could hardly speak or swallow: my heart was strained and I had\\nconsiderable pain. At such a time I was only a nuisance, but nothing\\ncould have exceeded his kindness and his skill with the few drugs which\\nwe possessed.\\nAgain and again in these days some one would see one or other of the\\nmissing parties coming in. It always proved to be mirage, a seal or\\npressure or I do not know what, but never could we quite persuade\\nourselves that these excitements might not have something in them, and\\nevery time hope sprang up anew. Meanwhile the matter of serious\\nimportance was the state of the ice in the bays between us and Cape\\nEvans: we _must_ get help. All the ice in the middle of the Sound was\\nswept out by the winds of March 30 to April 2, and on the following day\\nAtkinson climbed Arrival Heights to see how the remaining ice looked. The\\nview over the Sound from here is shown in the frontispiece to this book.\\n\\"The ice in the two bays to Cape Evans is quite new--formed this morning,\\nI suppose, with the rest that is in the Sound. There are open leads\\nbetween Glacier Tongue and Cape Evans, inside the line joining the ends\\nof the two. There is a big berg in between Glacier Tongue and the\\nIslands, and also a flat one off Cape Evans.\\"[274]\\nWe had some good freezing days after this, and on April 5 \\"we tried the\\nice this afternoon. It is naturally slushy and salt, but some hundred\\nyards from the old ice it is six inches thick: probably it averages about\\nthis thickness all over the Sound.\\"[275] Then we had a hard blizzard, on\\nthe fourth day of which it was possible to get up the Heights again and\\nsee for some distance. As far as could be judged the ice in the two bays\\nhad remained firm: these bays are those formed on either side of Glacier\\nTongue, by the Hut Point Peninsula on the south, and by Cape Evans and\\nthe islands on the north.","image":null},{"merge":"C14.06","output":"(summary) Atkinson, Keohane, and Dimitri set out from Cape Evans and traveled to Hutton Cliffs, sailed over the sea-ice, and arrived at Cape Evans completing their journey in an hour.

Lieutenant Evans was\\ninvalided home.\\nArcher had been landed to take Clissold\'s place as cook; another seaman,\\nWilliamson, was landed to take Forde\'s place, and of our sledging\\ncompanions he was the only fresh man. Wright was probably the most fit\\nafter him, and otherwise we had no one who, under ordinary circumstances,\\nwould have been considered fit to go out sledging again this season,\\nespecially at a time when the sun was just leaving us for the winter. We\\nwere sledged out.\\nThe next few days were occupied in making preparations for a further\\nsledge journey, and on April 13 a party started to return to Hut Point by\\nthe Hutton Cliffs. Atkinson, Wright, Keohane and Williamson were to try\\nand sledge up the western coast to help Campbell: Gran and Dimitri were\\nto stay with me at Hut Point. The surface of the sea-ice was now\\nextremely slushy and bad for pulling; the ice had begun to extrude its\\nsalt. A blizzard started in their faces, and they ran for shelter to the\\nlee of Little Razorback Island.

When I left them I found I could not\\nkeep my feet on the slippery snow and ice patches, and I had several\\nnasty falls, in one of which I gave my shoulder a twist. It was this\\nshaking combined with the rather desperate conditions which caused a more\\nacute state of illness and sickness than I had experienced for some time.\\nSome of those days I remained alone at Hut Point I was too weak to do\\nmore than crawl on my hands and knees about the hut. I had to get blubber\\nfrom the door to feed the fire, and chop up seal-meat to eat, to cook,\\nand to tend the dogs, some of whom were loose, while most of them were\\ntied in the verandah, or between the hut door and Vince\'s Cross. The hut\\nwas bitterly cold with only one man in it: had there not been some\\nmorphia among the stores brought down from Cape Evans I do not know what\\nI should have done.\\nThe dogs realized that they could take liberties which they would not\\nhave dared to do in different circumstances. They whined and growled, and\\nsquabbled amongst themselves all the time, day and night. Seven or eight\\ntimes one day I crawled across the floor to try and lay my hands upon one\\ndog who was the ringleader. I was sure it was Dyk, but never detected him\\nin the act, and though I thrashed him with difficulty as a speculation,\\nthe result was not encouraging. I would willingly have killed the lot of\\nthem just then, I am ashamed to say. I lay in my sleeping-bag with the\\nfloor of the hut falling from me, or its walls disappearing in the\\ndistance and coming back: and roused myself at intervals to feed blubber\\nto the stove. I felt as though I had been delivered out of hell when the\\nrelief party arrived on the night of April 14. I had been alone four\\ndays, and I think a few more days would have sent me off my head. Not the\\nleast welcome of the things they had brought me were my letters, copies\\nof the Weekly Times, a pair of felt shoes and a comb!\\nAtkinson\'s plan was to start on April 7 over the old sea-ice which lay to\\nthe south and south-west of us: he was to take with him Wright, Keohane\\nand Williamson, and they wanted to reach Butter Point, and thence to\\nsledge up the western coast. If the sea-ice was in, and Campbell was\\nsledging down upon it, they hoped to meet him and might be of the\\ngreatest assistance to him. Even if they did not meet him they could mark\\nmore obviously certain dep\xf4ts, of which he had no knowledge, left by our\\nown geological parties on the route he must follow. As I have already\\nmentioned, these were on Cape Roberts, off Granite Harbour, and on Cape\\nBernacchi, north of New Harbour: there was also a dep\xf4t at Butter Point,\\nbut Campbell already knew of this. They could also leave instructions to\\nthis effect at points where he would be likely to see them. There was no\\nquestion that there was grave risk in this journey. Not only was the\\nwinter approaching, and the daylight limited, but the sea-ice over which\\nthey must march was most dangerous. Sea-ice is always forming and being\\nblown out to sea, or just floating away on the tide at this time of year.\\nThe amount of old ice which had remained during the summer was certain to\\nbe limited: the new ice was thin and might take them out with it at any\\ntime. However, what could be done had to be done.\\nBefore they left certain signals by means of rockets and V\xe9ry lights were\\narranged, to be sent up by us at Hut Point if Campbell arrived: signals\\nhad also been arranged between Hut Point and Cape Evans in view of\\ncertain events. We did not have, but I think we ought to have had some\\nform of portable heliograph for communications between Hut Point and Cape\\nEvans when the sun was up and some kind of lamp signal apparatus to use\\nduring the winter.\\nThey started at 10.30 A.M. on Wednesday, April 17. The sun was now only\\njust peeping over the northern horizon at mid-day, and would disappear\\nentirely in six more days, though of course there was a long twilight as\\nyet. For fresh men on old sea-ice it would not have been an easy venture:\\nfor worn-out men on a coast where the ice was probably freezing and\\nblowing out at odd times it was very brave.","image":null},{"merge":"C14.07","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"Atkinson and his team journey through bad weather and difficult sea-ice to create a depot for Campbell, but ultimately have to turn back and leave two weeks\' provisions.

Consequently they soon\\nbegan to be iced up. On the other hand they found old sea-ice and made\\ngood some 25 miles, camping on the evening of the 18th about four miles\\nfrom the Eskers. Next morning they had to venture upon newly frozen ice,\\nand a blizzard wind was blowing. They crossed the four miles from their\\nnight camp to the Eskers, glad enough to reach land the other side\\nwithout the ice going to sea with them. They then turned towards the\\nButter Point Dep\xf4t, but were compelled to camp owing to the blizzard\\nwhich came on with full force. The rise in temperature to zero caused a\\ngeneral thaw of sleeping-bags and clothing which dried but little when\\nthe sun had no power. On the following morning they reached the Butter\\nPoint Dep\xf4t, which they found with difficulty, for there was no flag\\nstanding. Even as they struck their camp they saw the ice to the north of\\nthem breaking up and going out to sea. There was nothing to do but to\\nturn back, for neither could they go north to Campbell nor could Campbell\\ncome south to them. Wright now told Atkinson how much he had been opposed\\nto this journey all along: \\"he had come on this trip fully believing that\\nthere was every possibility of the party being lost, but had never\\ndemurred and never offered a contrary opinion, and one cannot be thankful\\nenough to such men.\\"[277] They made up the Butter Point Dep\xf4t, marked it\\nas well as they could in case Campbell should arrive there, and left two\\nweeks\' provisions for him. They could do no more.\\nThey got back to the Eskers that same day and anxiously awaited the\\ntwilight of the morning to reveal the state of the new sea-ice which they\\nhad crossed on their outward journey. To their joy some of it remained\\nand they started to do the four miles between them and the old sea-ice.\\nFor two miles they ran with the sail set: then they had a hard pull, and\\nsome Emperor penguins whom they could see led them to suppose that there\\nwas open water ahead. But they got through all right, and did ten miles\\nfor the day. On Monday 22, \\"blizzard in morning, so started late, and\\nmade for end of Pinnacled Ice. We found our little bay of sea-ice all\\ngone out. Luckily there was a sort of ice-foot around the Pinnacled Ice\\nand we completed seven miles and got through.\\"[278]\\n_Tuesday, April 23._ \\"Atkinson and his party got in about 7 P.M. after a\\nlong pull all day in very bad weather. They are just in the state of a\\nparty which has been out on a very cold spring journey: clothes and\\nsleeping-bags very wet, sweaters, pyjama coats and so forth full of snow.\\nAtkinson looks quite done up, his cheeks are fallen in and his throat\\nshows thin. Wright is also a good deal done up, and the whole party has\\nevidently had little sleep. They have had a difficult and dangerous trip,\\nand it is a good thing they are in, and they are fortunate to have had no\\nmishaps, for the sea-ice is constantly going out over there, and when\\nthey were on it they never knew that they might not find themselves cut\\noff from the shore. Big leads were constantly opening, even in ice over a\\nfoot thick and with little wind. But even if the ice had been in I do not\\nbelieve that they could have gone many days.\\"[279]\\nThat same day the sun appeared for the last time for four months.\\nApril 28 seemed to be a quite good day when we woke, and Wright, Keohane\\nand Gran started back for Cape Evans before 10 A.M. We could then see the\\noutline of Inaccessible Island, and the ice in the Sound looked fairly\\nfirm. So they determined to go by the way of the sea-ice under Castle\\nRock instead of going along the Peninsula to the Hutton Cliffs. Soon\\nafter they started it came up thick, and by 11.30 it was blowing a mild\\nblizzard with a low temperature. We felt considerable anxiety, especially\\nwhen a full blizzard set in with a temperature down to -31\xb0, and we could\\nnot see how the ice was standing it. Two days later it cleared, and that\\nnight a flare was lit at Cape Evans at a pre-arranged time, by which\\nsignal we knew that they had arrived safely. We heard afterwards that\\nwhen it came up thick they decided to follow the land which was the only\\nthing that they could see. They soon found that the ice was not nearly so\\ngood as was supposed: there were open pools of water, and some of the ice\\nwas moving up and down with their weight as they crossed it: Gran put his\\nfoot in. Then Wright went ahead with the Alpine rope, the ice being blue,\\nthe pulling easy, and the wind force 4-5. As far as Turtleback Island the\\nice was newly frozen, but after that they knew they were on oldish ice.\\nThey were lost on Cape Evans in the blizzard for some time, but\\neventually found the hut safely. One of the lessons of this expedition is\\nthat too little care was taken in travelling on sea-ice.\\nAtkinson, Dimitri and I left for Cape Evans with the two dog-teams on May\\n1. Directly we started it was evident that the surface was very bad: even\\nthe ice near Hut Point, which had been frozen for a long time, was hard\\npulling for the dogs, and when after less than a mile we got on to ice\\nwhich had frozen quite lately the sledges were running on snow which in\\nturn lay on salt sleet. It seemed a long time before we got abreast of\\nCastle Rock, following close along the land for the weather was very\\nthick: when we started we could just see the outline of Inaccessible\\nIsland, but by now the horizon was lost in the dusk and haze. We decided\\nto push on to Turtleback Island and go over Glacier Tongue in order to\\nget on to the older ice as soon as possible. The dogs began to get very\\ndone: Manuki Noogis, who had been harnessed in as leader (for Rabchick\\nhad deserted in the night), gave in completely, lay down and refused to\\nbe persuaded to go on: we had to cast him off and hope that he would\\nfollow. After a time Turtleback Island was visible in the gloom, but it\\nwas all we could do, pushing and pulling the sledges to help the dogs, to\\nget them so far. We were now on the older ice: our way was easier and we\\nreached Cape Evans without further incident. We found Rabchick on\\narrival, but no Manuki Noogis, who never reappeared.\\nAs we neared the Cape Atkinson turned to me: \\"Would you go for Campbell\\nor the Polar Party next year?\\" he said. \\"Campbell,\\" I answered: just then\\nit seemed to me unthinkable that we should leave live men to search for\\nthose who were dead.\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [259] See Introduction, pp. l, lii-lix.\\n   [260] See pp. 353, 383.\\n   [261] See pp. 382, 383.\\n   [262] My own diary.\\n   [263] See p. 115.\\n   [264] _British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-1913_, \\"Meteorology,\\" by\\n         G.

The problems which presented themselves were\\nunique in the history of Arctic travel, the weather conditions which had\\nto be faced during this last winter were such as had never been met in\\nMcMurdo Sound! The sledging personnel had lately undergone journeys, in\\none case no less than four journeys, of major importance, until they were\\nabsolutely worn out. The successful issue of the party was a triumph of\\ngood management and good fellowship. The saving clause was that as\\nregards hut, food, heat, clothing and the domestic life generally we were\\nsplendidly found. To the north of us, some hundreds of miles away,\\nCampbell\'s party of six men must be fighting for their lives against\\nthese same conditions, or worse--unless indeed they had already perished\\non their way south. We knew they must be in desperate plight, but\\nprobably they were alive: the point in their favour was that they were\\nfresh men. To the south of us, anywhere between us and the Pole, were\\nfive men. We knew _they_ must be dead.\\nThe immediate problem which presented itself was how best to use the\\nresources which were left to us. Our numbers were much reduced. Nine men\\nhad gone home before any hint of tragedy reached them. Two men had been\\nlanded from the ship. We were thirteen men for this last year. Of these\\nthirteen it was almost certain that Debenham would be unable to go out\\nsledging again owing to an injury to his knee: Archer had come to cook\\nand not to sledge: and it was also doubtful about myself. As a matter of\\nfact our sledging numbers for the last summer totalled eleven, five\\nofficers and six men.\\nWe were well provided with transport, having the seven mules sent down by\\nthe Indian Government, which were excellent animals, as well as our\\noriginal two dog-teams: the additional dogs brought down by the ship were\\nwith two exceptions of no real sledging value. Our dog-teams had,\\nhowever, already travelled some 1500 miles on the Barrier alone, not\\ncounting the work they had done between Hut Point and Cape Evans; and,\\nthough we did not realize it at this time, they were sick of it and never\\nworked again with that dash which we had come to expect of them.\\nThe first thing which we settled about the winter which lay ahead of us\\nwas that, so far as possible, everything should go on as usual. The\\nscientific work must of course be continued, and there were the dogs and\\nmules to be looked after: a night-watch to be kept and the meteorological\\nobservations and auroral notes to be taken. Owing to our reduced numbers\\nwe should need the help of the seamen for this purpose. We were also to\\nbring out another volume of the South Polar Times on Mid-winter Day. The\\nimportance of not allowing any sense of depression to become a part of\\nthe atmosphere of our life was clear to all. This was all the more\\nnecessary when, as we shall see, the constant blizzards confined us week\\nafter week to our hut. Even when we did get a fine day we were almost\\nentirely confined to the rocky cape for our exercise and walks. When\\nthere was sea-ice it was most unsafe.\\nAtkinson was in command: in addition, he and Dimitri took over the care\\nof the dogs. Many of these, both those which had been out sledging and\\nthose just arrived, were in a very poor state, and a dog hospital was\\nsoon built. At this date we had 24 dogs left from the last year, and 11\\ndogs brought down recently by the ship: three of the new dogs had already\\ndied. Lashly was in charge of the seven mules, which were allotted to\\nseven men for exercise: Nelson was to continue his marine biological\\nwork: Wright was to be meteorologist as well as chemist and physicist:\\nGran was in charge of stores, and would help Wright in the meteorological\\nobservations: Debenham was geologist and photographer. I was ordered to\\ntake a long rest, but could do the zoological work, the South Polar\\nTimes, and keep the Official Account of the Expedition from day to day.\\nCrean was in charge of sledging stores and equipment. Archer was cook.\\nHooper, our domestic, took over in addition the working of the acetylene\\nplant. There was plenty of work for our other two seamen, Keohane and\\nWilliamson, in the daily life of the camp and in preparations for the\\nsledging season to come.\\nThe blizzard which threatened us all the way from Hut Point on May 1\\nbroke soon after we got in. The ice in North Bay, which had been frozen\\nfor some time, was taken out on the first day of this blizzard, with the\\nexception of a small strip running close along the shore. The rest\\nfollowed the next afternoon, when the wind was still rising, and blew in\\nthe gusts up to 89 miles an hour. The curious thing was that all this\\ntime the air had been quite clear.\\nThis was the second day of the blizzard. The wind continued in violence\\nas the night wore on, and it began to snow, becoming very thick. From 3\\nA.M. to 4 A.M. the wind was so strong that there was a continuous rattle\\nof sand and stones up against the wall of the hut. The greater part of\\nthe time the anemometer head was choked by the drifting snow, and\\nDebenham, whose night-watch it was, had a bad time in clearing it at 4\\nA.M. During the period when it was working it registered a gust of over\\n91 miles an hour. While it was not working there came a gust which woke\\nmost people up, and which was a far more powerful one, making a regular\\nhail of stones against the wall. The next morning the wind was found to\\nbe averaging 104 miles an hour when the anemometer on the hill was\\nchecked for three minutes. Later it was averaging 78 miles an hour. This\\nblizzard continued to rage all this day and the next, but on May 6, which\\nwas one of those clear beautiful days when it is hard to believe that it\\ncan ever blow again, we could see something of the damage to the sea-ice.\\nThe centre of the Sound was clear of ice, and the open water stretched to\\nthe S. W. of us as far back as Tent Island. We were to have many worse\\nblizzards during this winter, but this particular blow was important\\nbecause it came at a critical time in the freezing over of the sea, and,\\nonce it had been dispersed, the winds of the future never allowed the ice\\nto form again sufficiently thick to withstand the wind forces which\\nobtained.\\nThus I find in my diary of May 8: \\"Up to the present we have never\\nconsidered the possibility of the sea in this neighbourhood, and the\\nSound out to the west of us, not freezing over permanently in the winter.\\nBut here there is still open water, and it seems quite possible that\\nthere may not be any permanent freezing this year, at any rate to the\\nnorth of Inaccessible Island and this cape. Though North Bay is now\\nfrozen over, the ice in it was blown away during the night, and, having\\nbeen blown back again, is now only joined to the ice-foot by newly frozen\\nice.\\"","image":null},{"merge":"C15.02","output":"This passage describes the formation of sea-ice and the dangers it posed to the dogs, as well as the decision-making process of the expedition team in deciding whether to search for Campbell\'s Party or the Polar Party.

I watched it carefully as\\nfar as it was possible to do so in the dark. Sometimes at any rate the\\nsouthern side of the sea-ice moved out not only northwards from the land,\\nbut also slightly westwards from the glacier face. To the north-east the\\nice was sometimes pressed closely up against the glacier. It seemed that\\nthe whole sheet was subject to a screw movement, the origin of which was\\nsomewhere out by Inaccessible Island. The result was that we often had a\\nseries of leads of newly frozen ice stretching out for some forty yards\\nto an older piece of ice, each lead being of a different age. It was an\\ninteresting study in the formation of sea-ice, covered at times by very\\nbeautiful ice-flowers. But it was dangerous for the dogs, who sometimes\\ndid not realize that these leads were not strong enough to bear them.\\nVaida went in one day, but managed to scramble out on the far side. He\\nwas induced to return to the land with difficulty, just before the whole\\nsheet of ice upon which he stood floated out to sea. Noogis, Dimitri\'s\\ngood leader, wandered away several times during the winter: once at any\\nrate he seems to have been carried off on a piece of ice, and to have\\nmanaged to swim to land, for when he arrived in camp his coat was full of\\nicy slush: finally he disappeared altogether, all search for him was in\\nvain, and we never found out what had happened.\\n[Illustration: CAPE EVANS IN WINTER--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nVaida was a short-tempered strong animal, who must have about doubled his\\nweight since we came in from One Ton, and he became quite a house-dog\\nthis winter, waiting at the door to be patted by men as they went out,\\nand coming in sometimes during the night-watch. But he did not like to be\\nturned out in the morning, and for my part I did not like the job, for he\\ncould prove very nasty. We allowed a good many of the dogs to be loose\\nthis year, and sometimes, when standing quietly upon a rock on the cape,\\nthree or four of the dogs passed like shadows in the darkness, busily\\nhunting the ice-foot for seals: this was the trouble of giving them their\\nfreedom, and I regret to say we found many carcasses of seal and Emperor\\npenguins. There was one new dog, Lion, who accompanied me sometimes to\\nthe top of the Ramp to see how the ice lay out in the Sound. He seemed as\\ninterested in it as I was, and while I was using night-glasses would sit\\nand gaze out over the sea which according to its age lay white or black\\nat our feet. Of course we had a dog called Peary, and another one\\ncalled Cooke. Peary was killed on the Barrier because he would not pull.\\nCooke, however, was still with us, and seemed to have been ostracized by\\nhis fellows, a position which in some lop-sided way he enjoyed. Loose\\ndogs chased him at sight, and when Cooke appeared, and others were about,\\na regular steeplechase started. He also came up the Ramp with me one day:\\nhalf-way up he suddenly turned and fled for the hut as hard as he could\\ngo: three other dogs came round the rocks in full chase, and they all\\ngave the impression of thoroughly enjoying themselves.\\nThe question of what ought to be done for the best during the coming\\nsledging season must have been in the minds of all of us. Which of the\\ntwo missing parties were we to try and find? A winter journey to relieve\\nCampbell and his five men was out of the question. I doubt the\\npossibility of such a journey to Evans Coves with fit men: to us at any\\nrate it was unthinkable. Also if we could do the double journey up and\\ndown, Campbell could certainly do the single journey down. Add to this\\nthat there was every sign of open water under the Western Mountains,\\nthough this did not influence us much when the decision was made. The\\nproblem as it presented itself to us was much as follows:\\nCampbell\'s Party _might_ have been picked up by the Terra Nova. Pennell\\nmeant to have another try to reach him on his way north, and it was\\nprobable that the ship would not be able to communicate again with Cape\\nEvans owing to ice: on the other hand it was likely that the ship had\\n_not_ been able to relieve him. It also seemed that he could not have\\ntravelled down the coast at this time, owing to the state of the sea-ice.\\nThe danger to him and his men was primarily during the winter: every day\\nafter the winter his danger was lessened. If we started in the end of\\nOctober to relieve Campbell, estimating the probable date of arrival of\\nthe ship, we judged that we could reach him only five or six weeks before\\nthe ship relieved him. All the same Campbell and his men might be alive,\\nand, having lived through the winter, the arrival of help might make the\\ndifference between life and death.\\nOn the other hand we knew that the Polar Party must be dead. They might\\nbe anywhere between Hut Point and the Pole, drifted over by snow, or\\nlying at the bottom of a crevasse, which seemed the most likely thing to\\nhave happened. From the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t in 85\xb0 5\xb4 S. to the Pole,\\nthat is the whole distance of the Plateau Journey, we did not know the\\ncourses they had steered nor the position of their dep\xf4ts, for Lieutenant\\nEvans, who brought back the Last Return Party, was invalided home and\\nneither of the seamen who remained of this party knew the courses.\\nAfter the experience of both the supporting parties on their way down the\\nBeardmore Glacier, when we all got into frightfully crevassed areas, it\\nwas the general opinion that the Polar Party must have fallen down a\\ncrevasse; the weight of five men, as compared with the four men and three\\nmen of the other return parties, supported this theory. Lashly was\\ninclined to think they had had scurvy. The true solution never once\\noccurred to us, for they had full rations for a very much longer period\\nof time than, according to their averages to 87\xb0 32\xb4, they were likely to\\nbe out.\\nThe first object of the expedition had been the Pole. If some record was\\nnot found, their success or failure would for ever remain uncertain. Was\\nit due not only to the men and their relatives, but also to the\\nexpedition, to ascertain their fate if possible?\\nThe chance of finding the remains of the Southern Party did not seem very\\ngreat. At the same time Scott was strict about leaving notes at dep\xf4ts,\\nand it seemed likely that he would have left some record at the Upper\\nGlacier Dep\xf4t before starting to descend the Beardmore Glacier: it would\\nbe interesting to know whether he did so. If we went south we must be\\nprepared to reach this dep\xf4t: farther than that, I have explained, we\\ncould not track him. On the other hand, if we went south prepared to go\\nto the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t, the number of sledging men necessary, in view\\nof the fact that we had no dep\xf4ts, would not allow of our sending a\\nsecond party to relieve Campbell.\\nIt was with all this in our minds that we sat down one evening in the hut\\nto decide what was to be done. The problem was a hard one. On the one\\nhand we might go south, fail entirely to find any trace of the Polar\\nParty, and while we were fruitlessly travelling all the summer Campbell\'s\\nmen might die for want of help. On the other hand we might go north, to\\nfind that Campbell\'s men were safe, and as a consequence the fate of the\\nPolar Party and the result of their efforts might remain for ever\\nunknown. Were we to forsake men who might be alive to look for those whom\\nwe knew were dead?\\nThese were the points put by Atkinson to the meeting of the whole party.\\nHe expressed his own conviction that we should go south, and then each\\nmember was asked what he thought. No one was for going north: one member\\nonly did not vote for going south, and he preferred not to give an\\nopinion. Considering the complexity of the question, I was surprised by\\nthis unanimity. We prepared for another Southern Journey.\\nIt is impossible to express and almost impossible to imagine how\\ndifficult it was to make this decision. Then we knew nothing: now we know\\nall. And nothing is harder than to realize in the light of facts the\\ndoubts which others have experienced in the fog of uncertainty.\\nOur winter routine worked very smoothly. Inside the hut we had a good\\ndeal more room than we needed, but this allowed of certain work being\\ndone in its shelter which would otherwise have had to be done outside.\\nFor instance we cut a hole through the floor of the dark-room, and\\nsledged in some heavy boulders of kenyte lava: these were frozen solidly\\ninto the rock upon which the hut was built by the simple method of\\npouring hot water over them, and the pedestal so formed was used by\\nWright for his pendulum observations. I was able to skin a number of\\nbirds in the hut; which, incidentally, was a very much colder place in\\nconsequence of the reduction in our numbers.\\nThe wind was most turbulent during this winter. The mean velocity of the\\nwind, in miles per hour, for the month of May was 24.6 m.p.h.; for June\\n30.9 m.p.h.; and for July 29.5 m.p.h. The percentage of hours when the\\nwind was blowing over fresh gale strength (42 m.p.h. on the Beaufort\\nscale) for the month of May was 24.5, for June 35, and for July 33 per\\ncent of the whole.\\nThese figures speak for themselves: after May we lived surrounded by an\\natmosphere of raging winds and blinding drift, and the sea at our door\\nwas never allowed to freeze permanently.","image":null},{"merge":"C15.03","output":"After the blizzard, Atkinson started a fish-trap through a hole in the sea-ice as external parasites are not common in the Antarctic and this was an interesting find.

We put a thermometer screen out upon\\nit, and Atkinson started a fish-trap through a hole in it. There was a\\ngood deal of competition over this trap: the seamen started a rival one,\\nwhich was to have been a very large affair, though it narrowed down to a\\nless ambitious business before it was finished. There was a sound of\\ncheering one morning, and Crean came in triumph from his fish-trap with a\\ncatch of 25. Atkinson\'s last catch had numbered one, but the seals had\\nfound his fishing-holes: a new hole caught fish until a seal found it.\\nOne of these fish, a Tremasome, had a parasitic growth over the dorsal\\nsheath. External parasites are not common in the Antarctic, and this was\\nan interesting find.\\nOn June 1 Dimitri and Hooper went with a team of nine dogs to and from\\nHut Point, to see if they could find Noogis, the dog which had left us on\\nour return on May 1. There was plenty of food for him to pick up there.\\nNo trace of him could be found. The party reported a bad running surface,\\nno pressure in the ice, as was the case the former year, but a large open\\nworking crack running from Great Razorback to Tent Island. There were big\\nsnowdrifts at Hut Point, as indeed was already the case at Cape Evans.\\nDuring the first days of June we got down into the minus thirties, and\\nour spirits rose as the thermometer dropped: we wanted permanent\\nsea-ice.\\n\\"_Saturday, June 8._ The weather changes since the night before last have\\nbeen, luckily for us, uncommon. Thursday evening a strong northerly wind\\nstarted with some drift, and this increased during the night until it\\nblew over forty miles an hour, the temperature being -22\xb0. A strong wind\\nfrom the north is rare, and generally is the prelude of a blizzard. This\\nnortherly wind fell towards morning, and the day was calm and clear, the\\ntemperature falling until it was -33\xb0 at 4 P.M. The barometer had been\\nabnormally low during the day, being only 28.24 at noon. Then at 8 P.M.\\nwith the temperature at -36\xb0, this blizzard broke, and at the same time\\nthere was a big upward jump of the barometer, which seemed to mark the\\nbeginning of the blizzard much more than the thermometer, which did not\\nrise much. The wind during the night was very high, blowing 72 and 66\\nmiles an hour, for hours at a time, and has not yet shown any sign of\\ndiminishing. Now, after lunch, the hut is straining and creaking, while a\\nshower of stones rattles at intervals against it: the drift is generally\\nvery heavy.\\"\\n\\"_Sunday, June 9._ The temperature has been higher, about zero, during\\nthe day, and the blizzard shows no signs of falling yet. The gusts are\\nstill of a very high velocity. A large quantity of ice to the north seems\\nto have gone out: at any rate our narrow strip along the front, which is\\nso valuable to us, will probably be permanent now.\\"\\n\\"_Monday, June 10._ A most turbulent day. It is very hard to settle down\\nto do anything, read or write, with such a turmoil outside, the hut\\nshaking until we begin to wonder how long it will stand such winds. Most\\nof the time the wind is averaging about sixty miles an hour, but the\\ngusts are far greater, and at times it seems that something must go. Just\\nbefore lunch I was racking my brains to write an Editorial for the South\\nPolar Times, and had congratulated ourselves on having the sea-ice which\\nis still in North Bay. As we were having lunch Nelson came in and said,\\n\'The thermometers have gone!\' All the ice in North Bay has gone. The part\\nimmediately next to the shore, which has now been in so long, and which\\nwas over two feet thick, we had considered sure to stay. On it has gone\\nout the North Bay thermometer screen with its instruments, which was\\nplaced 400 yards out, the fish-trap, some shovels and a sledge with a\\ncrowbar. The gusts were exceptionally strong at lunch, and the ice must\\nhave gone out very quickly. There was no sign of it afterwards, though it\\nwas not drifting much and we could see some distance. To lose this ice in\\nNorth Bay is a great disappointment, for it means so much to us here\\nwhether we have ice or water at our doors. We are now pretty well\\nconfined to the cape both for our own exercise and that of the mules, and\\nin the dark it is very rough walking. But if the ice in South Bay were to\\nfollow, it would be a calamity, cutting us off entirely from the south\\nand all sledging next year. Let us hope we shall be spared this.\\"\\nThis blizzard lasted for eight days, up till then the longest blizzard we\\nhad experienced: \\"It died as it had lived, blowing hard to the last,\\naveraging 68 miles an hour from the south, and then 56 miles an hour from\\nthe north, finally back to the south, and so to calm. To sit here with no\\nnoise of wind whistling in the ventilator, calm and starlight outside,\\nand North Bay freezing over once more, is a very great relief.\\"[280]\\nIt is noteworthy that this clearance of the ice, as also that in the\\nbeginning of May, coincided roughly with the maximum declination of the\\nmoon, and therefore with a run of spring tides.\\nIt would be tedious to give any detailed account of the winds and drift\\nwhich followed, night and day. There were few days which did not produce\\ntheir blizzard, but in contrast the hours of bright starlight were very\\nbeautiful. \\"Walking home over the cape in the darkness this afternoon I\\nsaw an eruption of Erebus which, compared with anything we have seen here\\nbefore, was very big. It looked as though a great mass of flame shot up\\nsome thousands of feet into the air, and, as suddenly as it rose, fell\\nagain, rising again to about half the height, and then disappearing.\\nThere was then a great column of steam rising from the crater, and\\nprobably, so Debenham asserts, it was not a flame which appeared, but the\\nreflection from a big bubble breaking in the crater. Afterwards the smoke\\ncloud stretched away southwards, and we could not see the end of\\nit.\\"[281]\\nBlizzard followed blizzard, and at the beginning of July we had four days\\nwhich were the thickest I have ever seen. Generally when you go out into\\na blizzard the drift is blown from your face and clothes, and though you\\ncannot see your stretched-out hand, especially on a dark winter day, the\\nwind prevents you being smothered. The wind also prevents the land,\\ntents, hut and cases from being covered. But during this blizzard the\\ndrift drove at you in such blankets of snow, that your person was\\nimmediately blotted out, your face covered and your eyes plugged up. Gran\\nlost himself for some time on the hill when taking the 8 A.M.\\nobservations, and Wright had difficulty in getting back from the magnetic\\ncave. Men had narrow escapes of losing themselves, though they were but a\\nfew feet from the hut.\\nWhen this blizzard cleared the camp was buried, and even on unobstructed\\nsurfaces the snowdrifts averaged four feet of additional depth. Two\\nenormous drifts ran down to the sea from either end of the hut. I do not\\nthink we ever found some of our stores again, but the larger part we\\ncarried up to the higher ground behind us where they remained fairly\\nclear. About this time I began to notice large sheets of anchor ice off\\nthe end of Cape Evans, that is to say, ice forming and remaining on the\\nbottom of the open sea. Now also the open water was extending round the\\ncape into the South Bay behind us: but it was too dark to get any\\nreliable idea of the distribution of ice in the Sound. We were afraid\\nthat we were cut off from Hut Point, but I do not believe that this was\\nthe case; though the open water must have stretched many miles to the\\nsouth in the middle of the Sound. The days when it was clear enough even\\nto potter about outside the hut were exceptional. God was very angry.","image":null},{"merge":"C15.04","output":"The passage describes various weather conditions experienced during the winter, including blizzards, winds, and shifting ice caused by tides and currents.

While we were having service some of the men went\\nover the camp to get ice for water. The sea-ice had been blown out of\\nNorth Bay, and the men supposed that the sea was open, and would look\\nblack, but Crean tells me that they nearly walked over the ice-foot, and,\\nwhen it cleared later, we saw the sea as white as the ice-foot itself. A\\nstrip of ice which was lying out in the Bay last night must have been\\nbrought in by the tide, even against a wind of some forty miles an hour.\\nThis shows what an influence the tides and currents have in comparison\\nwith the winds, for just at this time we are having very big tides. It\\nwas blowing and drifting all the morning, and the tide was flowing in,\\npressing the ice in under the ice-foot to such an extent that later it\\nremained there, though the tide was ebbing and a strong southerly was\\nblowing.\\"[282] Incidentally the bergs which were grounded in our\\nneighbourhood were shifted and broken about considerably by these high\\nwinds: also the meteorological screen placed on the Ramp the year before\\nwas broken from its upright, which had snapped in the middle, and must\\nhave been taken up into the air and so out to sea, for there was no trace\\nof it to be found: Wright lost two doors placed over the entrance to the\\nmagnetic cave: when he lifted them they were taken out of his hands by\\nthe wind, and disappeared into the air and were never seen again.\\n[Illustration: NORTH BAY AND THE BARNE GLACIER]\\nSo ready was the sea to freeze that there can be little doubt that it\\nalready contained large numbers of ice crystals, and time and again I\\nhave stood upon the ice-foot watching the tongues of the winds licking up\\nthe waters as they roared their way out to sea. Then, with no warning,\\nthere would come, suddenly and completely, a lull. And there would be a\\nfilm of ice, covering the surface of the sea, come so quickly that all\\nyou could say was that it was not there before and it was there now. And\\nthen down would come the wind again and it was gone. Once when the winter\\nhad gone and daylight had returned I stood upon the end of the cape, the\\nair all calm around me, and there, half-a-mile away, a full blizzard was\\nblowing: the islands, and even the berg between Inaccessible Island\\nand the cape, were totally obscured in the thickest drift: the top of the\\ndrift, which was very distinct, thinned to show dimly the crest of\\nInaccessible Island: Turk\'s Head was visible and Erebus quite clear. In\\nfact I was just on the edge of a thick blizzard, blowing down the Strait,\\nthe side showing as a perpendicular wall about 500 feet high and\\ntravelling, I should say, about 40 miles an hour. A roar came out from it\\nof the wind and waves.\\nThe weather conditions were extraordinarily local, as another experience\\nwill show. Atkinson and Dimitri were off to Hut Point with the dogs,\\ncarrying biscuit and pemmican for the coming Search Journey: I went with\\nthem some way, and then left them to place a flag upon the end of Glacier\\nTongue for surveying purposes. It was clear and bright, and it was easy\\nto get a sketch of the bearings of the islands from this position, which\\nshowed how great a portion of the Tongue must have broken off in the\\nautumn of 1911. I anticipated a pleasant walk home, but was somewhat\\nalarmed when heavy wind and drift came down from the direction of the\\nHutton Cliffs. Wearing spectacles, and being unable to see without them,\\nI managed to steer with difficulty by the sun which still showed dimly\\nthrough the drift. It was amazing suddenly to walk out of the wall of\\ndrift into light airs at Little Razorback Island. One minute it was\\nblowing and drifting hard and I could see almost nothing, the next it was\\ncalm, save for little whirlwinds of snow formed by eddies of air drawn in\\nfrom the north. In another three hundred yards the wind was blowing from\\nthe north. On this day Atkinson found wind force 8 and temperature -17\xb0\\nat Hut Point: at Cape Evans the temperature was zero and men were sitting\\non the rocks and smoking in the sun. Many instances might be given to\\nshow how local our weather conditions often were.\\nThere was a morning some time in the middle of the winter when we awoke\\nto one of our usual tearing blizzards. We had had some days of calm, and\\nthe ice had frozen sufficiently for the fish-trap to be lowered again.\\nBut that it would not stand much of this wind was obvious, and after\\nbreakfast Atkinson stuck out his jaw and said he wasn\'t going to lose\\nanother trap for any dash blizzard. He and Keohane sallied forth on to\\nthe ice, lost to our sight immediately in the darkness and drift. They\\ngot it, but arrived on the cape in quite a different place, and we were\\nglad to see them back. Soon afterwards the ice blew out.\\nMuch credit is due to the mule leaders that they were able to exercise\\ntheir animals without hurt. Cape Evans in the dark, strewn with great\\nboulders, with the open sea at your feet, is no easy place to manage a\\nvery high-spirited and excitable mule, just out of a warm stable,\\nespecially if this is his first outing for several days and the wind is\\nblowing fresh, and you are not sure if your face is frost-bitten, and you\\nare quite sure that your hands are. But the exercise was carried out\\nwithout mishap. The mules themselves were most anxious to go out, and\\nwhen Pyaree developed a housemaid\'s knee and was kept in, she revenged\\nherself upon her more fortunate companions by biting each one hard as it\\npassed her head on its way to and from the door. Gulab was the biggest\\nhandful, and Williamson managed him with skill: some of them, especially\\nLal Khan, were very playful, running round and round their leaders and\\nstopping to paw the ground: Khan Sahib, on the other hand, was bored,\\nyawning continually: it was suggested that he was suffering from polar\\nennui! Altogether they reflected the greatest credit upon Lashly, who\\ngroomed them every day and took the greatest care of them. They were\\nsubject to the most violent fits of jealousy, being much disturbed if a\\nrival got undue attention. The dog Vaida, however, was good friends with\\nthem all, going down the line and rubbing noses with them in their\\nstalls.\\nThe food of the mules was based upon that given by Oates to the ponies\\nthe year before, and the results were successful.\\nThe accommodation given to the dogs in the Terra Nova on the way south is\\nopen to criticism. As the reader may remember, they were chained on the\\ntop of the deck cargo on the main deck, and of course had a horrible\\ntime during the gale, and any subsequent bad weather, which did not\\nhowever last very long. But it was quite impossible to put them anywhere\\nelse, for every square inch between decks was so packed that even our\\npersonal belongings for more than two years were reduced to one small\\nuniform case. Any seaman will easily understand that to build houses or\\nshelters on deck over and above what we had already was out of the\\nquestion. As a matter of fact I doubt whether the dogs had a worse time\\nthan we during that gale. In good weather at sea, and at all times in the\\npack, they were comfortable enough. But future explorers might consider\\nwhether they can give their dogs more shelter during the winter than we\\nwere able to do. Amundsen, whose Winter Quarters were on the Barrier\\nitself, and who experienced lower temperatures and very much less wind\\nthan was our lot at Cape Evans, had his dogs in tents, and let them run\\nloose in the camp during the day. Tents would have gone in the winds we\\nexperienced, and I have explained that we had no snow in which we could\\nmake houses, as was done by Amundsen in the Barrier.\\nOur more peaceable dogs were allowed to run loose, especially during this\\nlast winter, at the beginning of which we also built a dog hospital. We\\nshould have liked to loose them all, but if we did so they immediately\\nflew at one another\'s throats. We might perhaps have let them loose if we\\nhad first taken the precaution Amundsen took, and muzzled all of them\\nbefore doing so. The sport of fighting, so his dogs discovered, lost all\\nits charm when they found they could not taste blood, and they gave it\\nup, and ran about unmuzzled and happy. But the slaughter among the seals\\nand penguins would have been horrible with us, and many dogs might have\\nbeen carried away on the breaking sea-ice. The tied-up ones lay under the\\nlee of a line of cases, each in his own hole. They curled up quite snugly\\nburied in the snowdrift when blizzards were blowing, and lay exactly in\\nthe same way when sledging on the Barrier, the first duty of the\\ndog-driver after pitching his own tent being to dig holes for each of his\\ndogs. It may be that these conditions are more natural to them than any\\nother, and that they are warmer when covered by the drifted snow than\\nthey would be in any unwarmed shelter: but this I doubt. At any rate they\\nthrove exceedingly under these rigorous conditions, soon becoming fat and\\nhealthy after the hardest sledge journeys, and their sledging record is a\\nvery fine one. We could not have built them a hut; as it was, we left our\\nmagnetic hut, a far smaller affair, in New Zealand, for there was no room\\nto stow it on the ship. I would not advise housing dogs in a hut built\\nwith a lean-to roof as an annexe to the main living-hut, but this would\\nbe one way of doing it if you are prepared to stand the noise and smell.","image":null},{"merge":"C15.05","output":"1.

We made seal pemmican for them and tried this when sledging,\\nas an occasional variation on biscuit, but they did not thrive on this\\ndiet. The oil in the biscuits caused purgation, as also did the pemmican:\\nthe fat was partly undigested and the excreta were eaten. The ponies also\\nate their excreta at times.

We lost many more dogs the last year, and\\nAtkinson has given me the following memorandum upon the parasite, a\\nnematode worm, which was discovered later to be the cause of the trouble:\\n\\"_Filaria immitis._--A certain proportion of the dogs became infected\\nwith this nematode, and it was the cause of their death, mainly in the\\nsecond year. It was present at the time the expedition started (1910) all\\ndown the Pacific side of Asia and Papua, and there was an examination\\nmicroscopically of all dogs imported at this time into New Zealand. The\\nsecondary host is the mosquito Culex.\\n\\"The symptoms varied. The onset was usually with intense pain, during\\nwhich the animal yelled and groaned: this was cardiac in origin and\\nreferable to the presence of the mature form in the beast. There was\\nmarked haematuria, and the animals were anaemic from actual loss of\\nhaemoglobins. In nearly all cases there was paralysis affecting the\\nhindquarters during the later stages, which tended to spread upwards and\\nfinally ended in death.\\n\\"The probable place of infection was Vladivostok before the dogs were put\\non board ship and deported to New Zealand. The only method of coping with\\nthe disease is prevention of infection in infected areas. It is probable\\nthat the mosquitoes would not bite after the dog\'s coat had been rubbed\\nwith paraffin: or mosquito netting might be placed over the kennels,\\nespecially at night time. The larval forms were found microscopically in\\nthe blood, and one mature form in the heart.\\"\\nWe were too careful about killing animals. I have explained how\\nCampbell\'s party was landed at Evans Coves. Some of the party wanted to\\nkill some seals on the off chance of the ship not turning up to relieve\\nthem. This was before they were in any way alarmed. But it was decided\\nthat life might be taken unnecessarily if they did this--and that winter\\nthis party nearly died of starvation. And yet this country has allowed\\npenguins to be killed by the million every year for Commerce and a\\nfarthing\'s worth of blubber.\\nWe never killed unless it was necessary, and what we had to kill was used\\nto the utmost both for food and for the scientific work in hand. The\\nfirst Emperor penguin we ever saw at Cape Evans was captured after an\\nexciting chase outside the hut in the middle of a blizzard. He kept us\\nbusy for days: the zoologist got a museum skin, showing some variation\\nfrom the usual coloration, a skeleton, and some useful observation on the\\ndigestive glands: the parasitologist got a new tape-worm: we all had a\\nchange of diet. Many a pheasant has died for less.\\nThere were plenty of Weddell seal round us this winter, but they kept out\\nof the wind and in the water for the most part. The sea is the warm place\\nof the Antarctic, for the temperature never falls below about 29\xb0 Fahr.,\\nand a seal which has been lying out on the ice in a minus thirty\\ntemperature, and perhaps some wind, must feel, as he slips into the sea,\\nmuch the same sensations as occur to us when we walk out of a cold\\nEnglish winter day into a heated conservatory. On the other hand, a\\nseaman went out into North Bay to bathe from a boat, in the full sun of a\\nmid-summer day, and he was out almost as soon as he was in. One of the\\nmost beautiful sights of this winter was to see the seals, outlined in\\nphosphorescent light, swimming and hunting in the dark water.\\nWe had lectures, but not as many as during the previous winter when they\\nbecame rather excessive: and we included outside subjects. We read in\\nmany a polar book of the depressions and trials of the long polar night;\\nbut thanks to gramophones, pianolas, variety of food, and some study of\\nthe needs both of mind and body, we suffered very little from the first\\nyear\'s months of darkness. There is quite a store of novelty in living in\\nthe dark: most of us I think thoroughly enjoyed it. But a second winter,\\nwith some of your best friends dead, and others in great difficulties,\\nperhaps dying, when all is unknown and every one is sledged to a\\nstandstill, and blizzards blow all day and all night, is a ghastly\\nexperience. This year there was not one of our company who did not\\nwelcome the return of the sun with thankfulness: all the more so since he\\ncame back to a land of blizzards and made many of our difficulties more\\neasy to tackle. Those who got little outside exercise were more affected\\nby the darkness than others. This last year, of course, the difficulties\\nof getting sufficient outdoor exercise were much increased. Variety is\\nimportant to the man who travels in polar regions: at all events those\\nwho went away on sledging expeditions stood the life more successfully\\nthan those whose duties tied them to the neighbourhood of the hut.\\nOther things being equal, the men with the greatest store of nervous\\nenergy came best through this expedition. Having more imagination, they\\nhave a worse time than their more phlegmatic companions; but they get\\nthings done. And when the worst came to the worst, their strength of mind\\ntriumphed over their weakness of body. If you want a good polar traveller\\nget a man without too much muscle, with good physical tone, and let his\\nmind be on wires--of steel. And if you can\'t get both, sacrifice physique\\nand bank on will.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\nNOTE\\nA lecture given at this time by Wright on Barrier Surfaces is especially\\ninteresting with relation to the Winter Journey and the tragedy of the\\nPolar Party. The general tend of friction set up by a sledge-runner upon\\nsnow of ordinary temperature may be called true _sliding_ friction: it is\\nprobable that the runners melt to an infinitesimal degree the millions of\\ncrystal points over which they glide: the sledge is running upon water.\\nCrystals in such temperatures are larger and softer than those\\nencountered in low temperatures. It is now that halos may be seen in the\\nsnow, almost reaching to your feet as you pull, and moving forward with\\nyou: we steered sometimes by keeping these halos at a certain angle to\\nus. My experience is that the best pulling surface is at an air\\ntemperature of about +17\xb0 Fahr.: Wright\'s experience is that below +5\xb0\\nduring summer temperatures on the Barrier the surface is fairly good,\\nthat between +5\xb0 and +15\xb0 less good, and between +15\xb0 and +25\xb0 best. The\\nworst is from +25\xb0 upwards, the worst of all being round about freezing\\npoint.\\nAs the temperature became high the amount of ice melted by this sliding\\nfriction was excessive. It was then that we found ice forming upon the\\nrunners, often in almost microscopic amounts, but nevertheless causing\\nthe sledges to drag seriously. Thus on the Beardmore we took enormous\\ncare to keep our runners free from ice, by scraping them at every halt\\nwith the back of our knives. This ice is perhaps formed when the runners\\nsink into the snow to an unusual depth, at which the temperature of the\\nsnow is sufficiently low to freeze the water previously formed by\\nfriction or radiation from the sun on to a dark runner.\\nIn very low temperatures the snow crystals become very small and very\\nhard, so hard that they will scratch the runners. The friction set up by\\nrunners in such temperatures may be known as _rolling_ friction, and the\\neffect, as experienced by us during the Winter Journey and elsewhere, is\\nmuch like pulling a sledge over sand. This rolling friction is that of\\nsnow crystal against snow crystal.\\nIf the barometer is rising you get flat crystals on the ice, if it is\\nfalling you get mirage and a blizzard. When you get mirage the air is\\nactually coming out of the Barrier. Thus far Wright\'s lecture.\\nSince we returned I have had a talk with Nansen about the sledge-runners\\nwhich he recommends to the future explorer. The ideal sledge-runner\\ncombines lightness and strength. He tells me that he would always have\\nmetal runners in high temperatures in which they will run better than\\nwood. In cold temperatures wood is necessary. Metal is stronger than wood\\nwith same weight. He has never used, but he suggests the possible use of,\\naluminium or magnesium for the metal. And he would also have wooden\\nrunners with metal runners attached, to be used alternately, if needed.","image":null},{"merge":"C15.06","output":"{\'summary\': \'The passage discusses the use, composition, and testing of sledges and runners on expeditions in cold climates, as well as the recommended materials and constructions for tents and sleeping bags.\',\\n \'excerpt_1\': \'Nansen suggests that the failure was due to the fact that these runners were\\\\nfitted at home.\',\\n \'excerpt_2\': \'If some instrument could be devised to test sledges in this way it would\\\\nbe of very great service.\',\\n \'text_to_image\': \'An instrument being attached between a sledge and a team of men to test the run of the sledge.

The effect of this is that the wood shrinks and the\\nGerman silver is not quite flat: the fitting should be done on the spot.\\nNansen did this himself on the Fram, and the result was excellent. [I\\nbelieve that these Discovery runners were not a continuous strip of metal\\nbut were built up in strips, which tore at the points of junction.]\\nBefore it is fitted, German silver should be heated red hot and allowed\\nto cool. This makes it more ductile, like lead, and therefore less\\nspringy: the metal should be as thin as possible.\\nAs runners melt the crystals and so run on water, metal is unsuitable for\\ncold snow. For low temperatures, therefore, Nansen would have wooden\\nrunners under the metal, the metal being taken off when cold conditions\\nobtained. He would choose such wood as is the best conductor of heat. He\\ntried birch wood in the first crossing of Greenland, but would not\\nrecommend it as being too easily broken. In the use of oak, ash, maple,\\nand doubtless also hickory, for runners, the rings of growth of the tree\\nshould be as far apart as possible: that is to say, they should be fast\\ngrowing. Ash with narrow rings breaks. There is ash and ash: American ash\\nis no good for this purpose; some Norwegian ash is useful, and some not.\\nOur own sledges with ash runners varied enormously. The runners of a\\nsledge should curve slightly, the centre being nearest to the snow. The\\nrunners of ski should curve also slightly, in this case upwards in the\\ncentre, i.e. from the snow. This is done by the way the wood is cut.\\nWood always dries with the curve from the heart towards the outside of\\nthe tree.\\nDuring our last year we had six new Norwegian sledges twelve feet long,\\nbrought down by the ship, with tapered runners of hickory which were 3\xbe\\ninches broad in the fore part and 2\xbc inches only at the stern. I believe\\nthat this was an idea of Scott, who considered that the broad runner in\\nfront would press down a path for the tapered part which followed, the\\ntotal area of friction being much less. We took one of them into South\\nBay one morning and tried it against an ordinary sledge, putting 490 lbs.\\non each of them. The surface included fairly soft as well as harder and\\nmore rubbly going. There was no difference of opinion that the sledge\\nwith the tapered runners pulled easier, and later we used these sledges\\non the Barrier with great success.\\nIf some instrument could be devised to test sledges in this way it would\\nbe of very great service. No team of men can make an exact estimate of\\nthe run of their own sledge, let alone the sledge which your pony or your\\ndogs are pulling. Yet sledges vary enormously, and it would be an\\nexcellent thing for a leader to be able to test his sledges before buying\\nthem, and also to be able to pick out the best for his more important\\nsledge journeys. I believe it can be done by attaching some kind of\\nbalance between the sledge and the men pulling it.\\nOther points mentioned by Nansen are as follows:\\nTarred ski are good: the snow does not stick so much. [This probably\\nrefers to the Norwegian compound known as Fahrt.] But he does not\\nrecommend tarred runners for sledges. Having had experience of a tent of\\nChinese silk which would go into his pocket but was very cold, he\\nrecommends a double tent, the inner lining being detached so that ice\\ncould be shaken from both coverings. He suggests the possibility of a\\nwoollen lining being warmer than cotton or silk or linen. I am, however,\\nof opinion that wool would collect more moisture from the cooker, and it\\ncertainly would be far more difficult to shake off the ice. For four men\\nhe would have two two-men sleeping-bags and a central pole coming down\\nbetween them, and the floor-cloth made in one piece with the tent. For\\nthree men a three-man sleeping-bag: e.g. for such a journey as our\\nWinter Journey. He would not brush rime, formed upon the tent by the\\nsteam from the cooker and breath, from the inside of tent before striking\\ncamp. The more of it the warmer. He considers that two- or three-men\\nsleeping-bags are infinitely warmer than single bags: objections of\\ndiscomfort are overcome, for you are so tired you go to sleep anyway. I\\nwould, however, recommend the explorer to read Scott\'s remarks upon the\\nsame subject before making up his mind.[285]\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [280] My own diary.\\n   [281] My own diary.\\n   [282] My own diary.\\n   [283] See Amundsen, _The South Pole_, vol. i. p. 264.\\n   [284] Ibid. vol. i. p. 119.\\n   [285] Scott, _Voyage of the Discovery_, vol. i. pp. 480-487.\\n\\n\\n","image":null},{"merge":"C16.01","output":"The passage describes various preparations and plans for a new journey to the south pole.

I can\\nremember now the joy of an August day when the sun looked over the rim of\\nthe Barne Glacier, and my shadow lay clear-cut upon the snow. It was\\nwonderful what a friendly thing that ice-slope became. We put the first\\ntrace upon the sunshine recorder; there was talk of expeditions to Cape\\nRoyds and Hut Point, and survey parties; and we ate our luncheon by the\\ndaylight which shone through the newly cleared window.\\nThe coming Search Journey was organized to reach the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t,\\nand the plans were modelled upon the Polar Journey of the year before.\\nBut now we had no extensive dep\xf4ts on the Barrier. It was intended that\\nthe dogs should run two trips out to Corner Camp during this spring. It\\nwas hoped that two parties of four men each might be able to ascend the\\nBeardmore, one of them remaining about half-way up and doing geological\\nand other scientific work while the other went up to the top.\\nIn our inmost thoughts we were full of doubts and fears. \\"I had a long\\ntalk with Lashly, who asked me what I candidly thought had happened to\\nthe Southern Party. I told him a crevasse. He says he does not think so:\\nhe thinks it is scurvy. Talking about crevasses he says that, on the\\nreturn of the Second Return Party, they came right over the ice-falls\\nsouth of Mount Darwin,--descending about 2000 feet into a great valley,\\ndown which they travelled towards the west, and so to the Upper Glacier\\nDep\xf4t. I believe Scott told Evans (Lieut.) that he meant to come back\\nthis same way.\\"\\n\\"Then the stuff they got into above the Cloudmaker must have been\\nhorrible. \'Why, there are places there you could put St. Paul\'s into, and\\nthat\'s no exaggeration, neither,\' and they spent two nights in it. All\\nthe way down to the Gateway he says there were crevasses, great big\\nfellows thirty feet across, which we of the First Return Party had\\ncrossed both going and coming back and which we never saw. But then much\\nof the snow had gone and they were visible. Lieut. Evans was very badly\\nsnowblind most of this time. Then outside the Gateway, on the Barrier,\\nthey crossed many crevasses, and some had fallen in where we had passed\\nover them.\\"\\n\\"This makes one think. Is the state of affairs in which we found the\\nglacier an extraordinary one, the snow being a special phenomenon due to\\nthat great blizzard and snowfall? Are we going to find blue ice this year\\nwhere we found thick soft snow last? Well! I have got a regular bad\\nneedle again, just as I have had before. But somehow the needle has\\nalways worked off when we get right into it. What a blessing it is that\\nthings are seldom as bad in the reality as you expect they are going to\\nbe in your imagination: though I must say the Winter Journey was worse\\neven than I had imagined. I remember that this time last year the thought\\nof the Beardmore was very terrible: but the reality was never very bad.\\"\\n\\"Lashly thinks it would be practically impossible for five men to\\ndisappear down a crevasse. Where three men got through (and he said it\\nwould be impossible to get worse stuff than they came through), five men\\nwould be still better off. This is not my view, however. I think that the\\nextra weight of one man might make all the difference in crossing a big\\ncrevasse: and if several men fell through one of those great bridges when\\nsledge and men were all on it, I do not think the bridge would hold the\\nsledge.\\"[286]\\nSeveral trips were made to Cape Royds over the Barne Glacier, and then by\\nportaging over the rocks to Shackleton\'s old hut. The sea was open here,\\nexcept for small niches of ice, and the hut and the cape were\\ncomparatively free from drifts; probably the open water had swallowed the\\ndrifting snow. Not so Hut Point, which was surrounded by huge drifts: the\\nverandah which we had built up as a stable was filled from floor to roof:\\nthere was no ice-foot to be seen, only a long snow-slope from the door to\\nthe sea-level. The hut itself, when we had dug our way into it, was\\nclear. We took down stores for the Search Journey, and brought back with\\nus the only surviving sledge-meter.\\nThese instruments, which indicate by a clockwork arrangement the distance\\ntravelled in miles and yards, are actuated by a wheel which runs behind\\nthe sledge. They are of the greatest possible use, especially when\\nsledging out of sight of land on the Barrier or Plateau, and we bitterly\\nregretted that we had no more. They do not have an easy time on a\\nglacier, and we lost the mechanism of one of our three Polar Journey\\nmeters when on the Beardmore. Dog-driving is hard on them; and\\npony-driving when the ponies are like Christopher plays the very deuce.\\nAnyway we found we had only one left for this year, and this was more or\\nless a dud. It was mended so far as possible but was never really\\nreliable, and latterly was useless. A lot of trouble was taken by Lashly\\nto make another with a bicycle wheel from one of our experimental trucks,\\nthe revolutions of which were marked on a counter which was almost\\nexactly similar to one of our anemometer registers. A bicycle wheel of\\ncourse stood much higher than our proper sledge-meters, and a difficulty\\nrose in fixing it to the sledge so as to prevent its wobbling and at the\\nsame time allow it the necessary amount of play.\\nMeanwhile the mules were being brought on in condition. With daylight and\\nimproved weather they were exercised with loaded sledges on the sea-ice\\nwhich still remained in South Bay. They went like lambs, and were\\nevidently used to the work. Gulab was a troublesome little animal: he had\\nno objection to pulling a sledge, but was just ultra-timid. Again and\\nagain he was got into position for having his traces hitched on, and each\\ntime some little thing, the flapping of a mitt, the touch of the trace,\\nor the feel of the bow of the sledge, frightened him and he was off, and\\nthe same performance had to be repeated. Once harnessed he was very good.\\nThe breast harness sent down for them by the Indian Government was used:\\nit was excellent; though Oates, I believe, had an idea that collars were\\nbetter. However, we had not got the collars. The mules themselves looked\\nvery fit and strong: our only doubt was whether their small hoofs would\\nsink into soft snow even farther than the ponies had done.\\nNo record of this expedition would be complete without some mention of\\nthe cases of fire which occurred. The first was in the lazarette of the\\nship on the voyage to Cape Town: it was caused by an overturned lamp and\\neasily extinguished. The second was during our first winter in the\\nAntarctic, when there was a fire in the motor shed, which was formed by\\nfull petrol cases built up round the motors, and roofed with a tarpaulin.\\nThis threatened to be more serious, but was also put out without much\\ndifficulty. The third and fourth cases were during the winter which had\\njust passed, and were both inside Winter Quarters.\\nWright wanted a lamp to heat a shed which he was building out of cases\\nand tarpaulins for certain of his work. He brought a lamp (not a primus)\\ninto the hut, and tried to make it work. He spent some time in the\\nmorning on this, and after lunch Nelson joined him. The lamp was fitted\\nwith an indicator to show the pressure obtained by pumping. Nelson was\\npumping, kneeling at the end of the table next the bulkhead which divided\\nthe officers\' and men\'s quarters: his head was level with the lamp, and\\nthe indicator was not showing a high pressure. Wright was standing close\\nby. Suddenly the lamp burst, a rent three inches long appearing in the\\njoin where the bottom of the oil reservoir is fitted to the rest of the\\nbowl. Twenty places were alight immediately, clothing, bedding, papers\\nand patches of burning oil were all over the table and floor. Luckily\\neverybody was in the hut, for it was blowing a blizzard and minus twenty\\noutside.

We were bagging pemmican in the hut when some one said, \\"Can you\\nsmell burning?\\" At first we could not see anything wrong, and Gran said\\nit must be some brown paper he had burnt; but after three or four\\nminutes, looking upwards, we saw that the top of the chimney piping was\\nred hot where it went out through the roof, as was also a large\\nventilator trap which entered the flue at this point. We put salt down\\nfrom outside, and the fire seemed to die down, but shortly afterwards the\\nventilator trap fell on to the table, leaving a cake of burning soot\\nexposed. This luckily did not fall, and we raked it down into buckets.\\nAbout a quarter of an hour afterwards all the chimney started blazing\\nagain, the flames shooting up into the blizzard outside. We got this out\\nby pushing snow in at the top, and holding baths and buckets below to\\ncatch the d\xe9bris. We then did what we ought to have done at the beginning\\nof the winter--took the piping down and cleaned it all out.\\nOur last fire was a little business. Debenham and I were at Hut Point. I\\nnoticed that the place was full of smoke, which was quite usual with a\\nblubber fire, but afterwards we found that the old hut was alight between\\nthe two roofs. The inner roof was too shaky to allow one to walk on it,\\nand so, at Debenham\'s suggestion, we bent a tube which was lying about\\nand syphoned some water up with complete success. Our more usual fire\\nextinguishers were Minimax, and they left nothing to be desired: indeed,\\nall they left were the acid stains on the material touched.\\nFrom such grim considerations it is a pleasure to turn to the out-of-door\\nlife we now led. Emperor penguins began to visit us in companies up to\\nforty in number: probably they were birds whose maternal or paternal\\ninstincts had been thwarted at Cape Crozier and had now taken to a\\nvagrant life. They suffered, I am afraid, from the loose dogs, and on one\\noccasion Debenham was out on the sea-ice with a team of those dogs of\\nours which were useless for serious sledging. He had taken them in hand\\nand formed a team which was very creditable to him, if not to themselves.\\nOn this occasion he had managed with great difficulty to restrain them\\nfrom joining a company of Emperors. The dogs were frantic, the Emperors\\nundisturbed. Unable to go himself, one dog called Little Ginger\\nunselfishly bit through the harness which restrained two of his\\ncompanions, and Debenham, helplessly holding the straining sledge, could\\nonly witness the slaughter, which followed.\\nThe first skua gull arrived on October 24, and we knew they would soon\\nbreed on any level gravel or rock free from snow; and we should see the\\nAntarctic petrels again, and perhaps a rare snowy petrel; and the first\\nwhales would be finding their way into McMurdo Sound. Also the Weddells,\\nthe common coastal seals of the Antarctic, were now, in the beginning of\\nOctober, leaving the open water and lying out on the ice. They were\\nnearly all females, and getting ready to give birth to their young.\\nThe Weddell seal is black on top, and splashed with silver in other\\nplaces. He measures up to 10 feet from nose to tail, eats fish, is\\ncorpulent and hulking. He sometimes carries four inches of blubber. On\\nthe ice he is one of the most sluggish of God\'s creatures, he sleeps\\ncontinually, digests huge meals, and grunts, gurgles, pipes, trills and\\nwhistles in the most engaging way. In the sea he is transformed into one\\nof the most elastic and lithe of beasts, catching his fish and swallowing\\nthem whole. As you stand over his blow-hole his head appears, and he\\nsnorts at you with surprise but no fear, opening and shutting his\\nnostrils the while as he takes in a supply of fresh air. It is clear that\\nthey travel for many miles beneath the ice, and I expect they find their\\nway from air-hole to air-hole by listening to the noise made by other\\nseals. Some of the air-holes are exit and entrance holes as well, and I\\nfound at least one seal which appeared to have died owing to its opening\\nfreezing up. They may be heard at times grinding these holes open with\\ntheir teeth (Ponting took some patient cinematographs showing the process\\nof sawing the openings to these wells) and their teeth are naturally much\\nworn by the time they become old. Wilson states that they are liable to\\nkidney trouble: their skin is often irritable, which may be due to the\\ndrying salt from the sea; and I have seen one seal which was covered with\\na suppurating rash. Their spleens are sometimes enormously enlarged when\\nthey first come out of the sea on to the ice, which is interesting\\nbecause no one seems to know much about spleens. Speculation was caused\\namongst us by the fact that some of these air-holes had as it were a\\ntrap-door above them. One day I was on the ice-foot at Cape Evans at a\\ntime when North Bay was frozen over with about an inch or more of ice. A\\nseal suddenly poked his nose up through this ice to get air, and when he\\ndisappeared a slab which had been raised by his head fell back into this\\ntrap position. Clearly this was the origin of the door.\\nWeddell seals and the Hut Point life are inextricably mixed up in my\\nrecollections of October. Atkinson, Debenham, Dimitri and I went down to\\nHut Point on the 12th, with the two dog-teams. We were to run two dep\xf4ts\\nout on to the Barrier, and Debenham, whose leg prevented his further\\nsledging, was to do geological work and a plane table survey. Those of us\\nwho had borne the brunt of the travelling of the two previous sledge\\nseasons were sick of sledging. For my own part I confess I viewed the\\nwhole proceedings with distaste, and I have no doubt the others did too;\\nbut the job had to be done if possible, and there was no good in saying\\nwe were sick of it. From beginning to end of this year men not only\\nlaboured willingly, but put their hearts and souls into the work. To have\\nto do another three months\' journey seemed bad enough, and to leave our\\ncomfortable Winter Quarters three weeks before we started on that journey\\nwas an additional irritation. We ran down in surface drift: it was thick\\nto the south, the wind bit our faces and hands; we could see nothing by\\nthe time we got in, and the snow was falling heavily. The stable was full\\nof beastly snow, the hut was cold and cheerless, and there was no blubber\\nfor the stove. And if we had only taken the ship and gone home when the\\nperiod for which we had joined was passed, we might have been in London\\nfor the last six months!\\nBut then the snow stopped, the wind went down, and the mountain tops\\nappeared in all their glorious beauty. We were in the middle of a perfect\\nsummer afternoon, with a warm sun beating on the rocks as we walked round\\nto Pram Point. There were many seals here already, and it was clear that\\nthe place would form a jolly nursery this year, for there must have been\\na lot of movement on the Barrier and the sea-ice was seamed with pressure\\nridges up to twenty feet in height. The hollows were buckled until the\\nsea water came up and formed frozen ponds which would thaw later into\\nlovely baths. Sheltered from the wind the children could chase their\\nridiculous tails to their hearts\' content: their mothers would lie and\\nsleep, awakening every now and then to scratch themselves with their long\\nfinger-nails. Not quite yet, but they were not far away: Lappy, one of\\nour dogs who always looked more like a spaniel than anything else, heard\\none under the ice and started to burrow down to him!\\nNearly three weeks later I paid several more visits to this delightful\\nplace. It was thick with seals, big seals and little seals, hairy seals\\nand woolly seals: every day added appreciably to the number of babies,\\nand to the baaings and bleatings which made the place sound like a great\\nsheepfold. In every case where I approached, the mothers opened their\\nmouths and bellowed at me to keep away, but they did not come for me\\nthough I actually stroked one baby. Often when the mother bellowed the\\nlittle one would also open his mouth, producing just the ghost of a\\nbellow: not because he seemed afraid of us, but rather because he\\nthought it was the right thing to do: as indeed it probably was. One old\\ncow was marked with hoops all round her body, like an advertisement of\\nMichelin tyres: only the hoops were but an inch apart from one another,\\nand seemed to be formed by darker and longer bands of hair: probably\\nsomething to do with the summer moult. Two cows, which scrambled out of\\nthe same hole one after the other, were fighting, the hinder one biting\\nthe other savagely as she made an ungainly entrance. The first was not in\\ncalf, the aggressor, however, was: this may have had something to do with\\nit. They were both much cut about and bleeding.\\nA seal is never so pretty as when he is a baby. With his grey woolly\\ncoat, which he keeps for a fortnight, his comparatively long flippers and\\ntail, and his big dark eyes, he looks very clean and pussy-like. I\\nwatched one running round and round after his tail, putting his flipper\\nunder his head as a pillow, and scratching himself, seemingly as happy as\\npossible: yet it was pretty cold with some wind.","image":null},{"merge":"C16.03","output":"1.

The cow went\\nfor him bald-headed, with open mouth, bellowing and most disturbed. The\\nbull defended himself as best he might but absolutely refused to take the\\noffensive. The calf imitated his mother as best he could.\\nMeanwhile Atkinson and Dimitri took some mule-fodder and dog-biscuit to a\\npoint twelve miles south of Corner Camp. They started on October 14 with\\nthe two dog-teams and found a most terrible surface on the Barrier, the\\nsledges sometimes sinking as far as the \'fore-and-afters\'; the minimum\\ntemperatures the first two nights were -39\xb0 and -25\xb0; strong blizzard at\\nCorner Camp; a lie-up for a day and a half, before they could push on in\\nwind and drift and lay the dep\xf4t. The dogs ran back from Corner Camp to\\nHut Point on October 19, a distance of thirty miles. Three miles from\\nCorner Camp three dogs of Atkinson\'s team fell into a crevasse, one of\\nthem falling right down to the length of his harness. The rest of the\\nteam, however, pulled on, and dragged the three dogs out as they went.\\nAtkinson lost his driving-stick, which was left standing in the snow and\\nserved to mark a place to be avoided. Altogether a rather lucky escape:\\ntwo men out alone with two dog-teams are somewhat helpless in case of\\nemergency.\\nOn October 25 Dimitri and I started to take a further dep\xf4t out to Corner\\nCamp with the two dog-teams, pulling about 600 lbs. each. We found a much\\nbetter surface than that experienced by Atkinson; in places really smooth\\nand hard. \\"It is good to be out again in such weather, and it has been a\\nvery pleasant day.\\" The minimum was only -24\xb0 that night, and we reached\\nCorner Camp on the afternoon of the next day, following the old tracks\\nwhere possible, and halting occasionally to hunt when we lost them. \\"Here\\nwe made the dep\xf4t and the dogs had a rest of 3\xbd hours, and two biscuits.\\nIt was quaint to see them waiting for more food, for they knew they had\\nnot had their full whack.\\"[287]\\nThere was plenty of evidence that the Barrier had moved a long way during\\nthe last year. It had buckled up the sea-ice at Pram Point; there were at\\nleast three new and well-marked undulations before reaching Corner Camp;\\nand the camp itself had moved visibly, judged by the bearings and\\nsketches we possessed. I believe the annual movement had not been less\\nthan half a mile.\\nCorner Camp is a well-known trap for blizzards on the line of their exit\\nat Cape Crozier, and it was clouding up, the barometer falling, and the\\ntemperature rising rapidly. \\"So we decided to come back some way, and\\nhave in the end come right back to the Biscuit Dep\xf4t, since it looked\\nvery threatening to the east. Here the temperature is lower (-15\xb0) and it\\nis clearing. Ross Island has been largely obscured, but the clouds are\\nopening on Terror. We had a very good run and the dogs pulled splendidly,\\nmaking light work of it: 29 miles for the day, half of it with loaded\\nsledges! Lappy\'s feet are bleeding a good bit, owing to the snow balling\\nin between his toes where the hair is unusually long. Bullet, who is fat\\nand did not pull, celebrated his arrival in camp by going for Bielchik\\nwho had pulled splendidly all day! There is much mirage, and Observation\\nHill and Castle Rock are reversed.\\"[288] We reached Hut Point the next\\nday. Lappy\'s feet were still bad, and Dimitri wrapped him in his\\nwindproof blouse and strapped him on to the sledge. All went well until\\nwe got on to the sea-ice, when Lappy escaped and arrived an easy first.\\nDog-driving is the devil! Before I started, my language would not have\\nshamed a Sunday School, and now--if it were not Sunday I would tell you\\nmore about it. It takes all kinds to make a world and a dog-team. We had\\naristocrats like Osman, and Bolsheviks like Krisravitza, and lunatics\\nlike Hol-hol. The present-day employer of labour might stand amazed when\\nhe saw a crowd of prospective workmen go mad with joy at the sight of\\ntheir driver approaching them with a harness in his hands. The most\\nardent trade unionist might boil with rage at the sight of eleven or\\nthirteen huskies dragging a heavy load, including their idle master, over\\nthe floe with every appearance of intense joy. But truth to tell there\\nwere signs that they were getting rather sick of it, and within a few\\ndays we were to learn that dogs can chuck their paws in as well as many\\nanother. They had their king, of course: Osman was that. They combined\\nreadily and with immense effect against any companion who did not pull\\nhis weight, or against one who pulled too much. Dyk was unpopular among\\nthem, for when the team of which he was a member was halted he\\nconstantly whined and tugged at his harness in his eagerness to go on:\\nthis did not allow the rest of the team to rest, and they were\\njustifiably resentful. Sometimes a team got a down upon a dog without our\\nbeing able to discover their doggy reason. In any case we had to watch\\ncarefully to prevent them carrying out their intentions, their method of\\npunishment always being the same and ending, if unchecked, in what they\\nprobably called justice, and we called murder.\\nI have referred to the crusts on the Barrier, where the snow lies in\\nlayers with an air-space, perhaps a quarter of an inch, or more, between\\nthem. These will subside as you pass over them, giving the inexperienced\\npolar traveller some nasty moments until he learns that they are not\\ncrevasses. But the dogs thought they were rabbits, and pounced, time\\nafter time. There was a little dog called Mukaka, who got dragged under\\nthe sledge in one of the mad penguin rushes the dog-teams made when we\\nwere landing stores from the Terra Nova: his back was hurt and afterwards\\nhe died. \\"He is paired with a fat, lazy and very greedy black dog, Noogis\\nby name, and in every march this sprightly little Mukaka will once or\\ntwice notice that Noogis is not pulling and will jump over the trace,\\nbite Noogis like a snap, and be back again in his own place before the\\nfat dog knows what has happened.\\"[289]\\nThen there was Stareek (which is the Russian for old man, starouka being\\nold woman). \\"He is quite a ridiculous \'old man,\' and quite the nicest,\\nquietest, cleverest old dog I have ever come across. He looks in face as\\nthough he knew all the wickedness of all the world and all its cares, and\\nas if he were bored to death by them.\\"[290] He was the leader of Wilson\'s\\nteam on the Dep\xf4t Journey, but decided that he was not going out again.\\nThereafter when he thought there was no one looking he walked naturally;\\nbut if he saw you looking at him he immediately had a frost-bitten paw,\\nlimped painfully over the snow, and looked so pitiful that only brutes\\nlike us could think of putting him to pull a sledge. We tried but he\\nrefused to work, and his final victory was complete.\\nOne more story: Dimitri is telling us how a \\"funny old Stareek\\" at Sydney\\ncame and objected to his treatment of the dogs (which were more than half\\nwolves and would eat you without provocation). \\"He says to me, \'You not\\nwhip\'--I say, \'What ho!\' He go and fetch Mr. Meares--he try put me in\\nchoky. Then he go to Anton--give Anton cigarette and match--he say--\'How\\nold that horse?\' pointing to Hackenschmidt--Anton say, very young--he not\\nbelieve--he go try see Hackenschmidt\'s teeth--and old Starouka too--and\\nHackenschmidt he draw back and he rush forward and bite old Stareek\\ntwice, and he fall backwards over case--and ole woman pick him up. He\\nvery white beard which went so--I not see him again.\\"\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [286] My own diary.\\n   [287] My own diary.\\n   [288] My own diary.\\n   [289] Wilson\'s Journal, _Scott\'s Last Expedition_, vol. i. p. 616.\\n   [290] Ibid.\\n\\n\\n","image":null},{"merge":"C17.01","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The Search Journey party, consisting of mules and men, leaves Hut Point to travel south for a search and rescue mission.

Hut Point._ A beautiful day. We finished digging out the\\nstable for the mules this morning and brought in some blubber this\\nafternoon. The Bluff has its cap on, but otherwise the sky is nearly\\nclear: there is a little cumulus between White Island and the Bluff, the\\nfirst I have seen this year on the Barrier. It is most noticeable how\\nmuch snow has disappeared off the rocks and shingle here.\\n_October 29. Hut Point._ The mule party, under Wright, consisting of\\nGran, Nelson, Crean, Hooper, Williamson, Keohane and Lashly, left Cape\\nEvans at 10.30 and arrived here at 5 P.M. after a good march in perfect\\nweather. They leave Debenham and Archer at the hut, and I am afraid it\\nwill be dull work for them the next three months. Archer turned out early\\nand made some cakes which they have brought with them. They camped for\\nlunch seven miles from Cape Evans.\\n[Illustration: THE MULE PARTY LEAVES CAPE EVANS--October 29, 1912]\\nThis is the start of the Search Journey. Everything which forethought can\\ndo has been done, and to a point twelve miles south of Corner Camp the\\nmules will be travelling light owing to the dep\xf4ts which have been laid.\\nThe barometer has been falling the last few days and is now low, while\\nthe Bluff is overcast. Yet it does not look like blizzard to come. Two\\nAd\xe9lie penguins, the first, came to Cape Evans yesterday, and a skua was\\nseen there on the 24th: so summer is really here.\\n_October 30. Hut Point._ It is now 8 P.M., and the mules are just off,\\nlooking very fit, keeping well together, and giving no trouble at the\\nstart. Their leaders turned in this afternoon, and to-night begins the\\nnew routine of night marching, just the same as last year. It did look\\nthick on the Barrier this afternoon, and it was quite a question whether\\nit was advisable for them to start. But it is rolling away now, being\\napparently only fog, which is now disappearing before some wind, or\\nperhaps because the sun is losing its power. I think they will have a\\ngood march.\\n_November 2_, 5 A.M. _Biscuit Dep\xf4t._ Atkinson, Dimitri and I, with two\\ndog-teams, left Hut Point last night at 8.30. We have had a coldish\\nnight\'s run, -21\xb0 when we left after lunch, -17\xb0 now. The surface was\\nvery heavy for the dogs, there being a soft coating of snow over\\neverything since we last came this way, due no doubt to the foggy days we\\nhave been having lately. The sledge-meter makes it nearly 16 miles.\\nThe mule party has two days\' start on us, and their programme is to do\\ntwelve miles a day to One Ton Dep\xf4t. Their tracks are fairly clear, but\\nthere has been some drift from the east since they passed. We picked up\\nour cairns well. We are pretty wet, having been running nearly all the\\nway.\\n_November 3._ Early morning. 14\xbd miles. We are here at Corner Camp, but\\nnot without a struggle. We left the Biscuit Dep\xf4t at 6.30 P.M. yesterday,\\nand it is now 4 A.M. The last six miles took us four hours, which is very\\nbad going for dogs, and we have all been running most of the way. The\\nsurface was very bad, crusty and also soft: it was blowing with some low\\ndrift, and overcast and snowing. We followed the drifted-up mule tracks\\nwith difficulty and are lucky to have got so far. The temperature has\\nbeen a constant zero.\\nThere is a note here from Wright about the mules, which left here last\\nnight. They only saw two small crevasses on the way, but Khan Sahib got\\ninto the tide-crack at the edge of the Barrier, and had to be hauled out\\nwith a rope. The mules are going fast over the first part of the day, but\\nshow a tendency to stop towards the end: they keep well together except\\nKhan Sahib, who is a slower mule than the others. It is now blowing with\\nsome drift, but nothing bad, and beyond the Bluff it seems to be clear.\\nWe are all pretty tired.\\n_November 4. Early morning._ Well! this has been a disappointing day, but\\nwe must hope that all will turn out well. We turned out at 2 A.M.\\nyesterday and then it was clearing all round, a mild blizzard having been\\nblowing since we camped. We started at five in some wind and low drift.\\nIt was good travelling weather, and except for the first three miles the\\nsurface has been fair to good, and the last part very good. Yet the dogs\\ncould not manage their load, which according to programme should go up a\\nfurther 150 lbs. each team here at Dimitri Dep\xf4t. One of our dogs, Kusoi,\\ngave out, but we managed to get him along tied to the stern of the\\nsledge, because the team behind tried to get at him and he realized he\\nhad better mend his ways. We camped for lunch when Tresor also was pretty\\nwell done. We were then on a very good surface, but were often pushing\\nthe sledge to get it along. The mule party were gone when we started\\nagain, and probably did not see us. We came on to the dep\xf4t, but we\\ncannot hope to get along far on bad surfaces if we cannot get along on\\ngood ones. The note left by Wright states that their sledge-meter has\\nproved useless, and this leaves all three parties of us with only one,\\nwhich is not very reliable now.\\nSo it has been decided that the dogs must return from 80\xb0 30\xb4, or 81\xb0 at\\nthe farthest, and instead of four mules, as was intended, going on from\\nthere, five must go on instead. The dogs can therefore now leave behind\\nmuch of their own weights and take on the mules\' weights instead. And\\nthis is the part where the mules\' weights are so heavy. Perhaps the new\\nscheme is the best, but it puts everything on the mules from 80\xb0 30\xb4: if\\nthey will do it all is well: if they won\'t we have nothing to fall back\\non.\\n_Midnight, November 4-5._ It has been blowing and drifting all day. We\\nturned out again at mid-day on the 4th, and re-made the dep\xf4t with what\\nwe were to leave owing to the new programme. This is all rather sad, but\\nit can\'t be helped. It was then blowing a summer blizzard, and we were\\ngetting frost-bitten when we started, following the mule tracks. There\\nwere plenty of cairns for us to pick up, and with the lighter loads and a\\nvery good surface we came along much better. Lunching at eight miles we\\narrived just as the mule party had finished their hoosh preparatory to\\nstarting, and it has been decided that the mules are not to go on\\nto-night, but we will all start marching together to-morrow.\\nThe news from this party is on the whole good, not the least good being\\nthat the sledge-meter is working again, though not very reliably. They\\nare marching well, and at a great pace, except for Khan Sahib. Gulab,\\nhowever, is terribly chafed both by his collar and by his breast harness,\\nboth of which have been tried. He has a great raw place where this fits\\non one side, and is chafed, but not so badly, on the other side. Lal Khan\\nis pulling well, but is eating very little. Pyaree is doing very well,\\nbut has some difficulty in lifting her leg when in soft snow. Abdullah\\nseems to be considered the best mule at present. On the whole good\\nhearing.\\nWright\'s sleeping-bag is bad, letting in light through cracks in a good\\nmany places. But he makes very little of it and does not seem to be\\ncold--saying it is good ventilation. The mule cloths, which have a rough\\nlining to their outside canvas, are collecting a lot of snow, and all the\\nmules are matted with cakes of snow. They are terrible rope-eaters,\\ncloth-eaters, anything to eat, though they are not hungry. And they have\\neven learnt to pull their picketing buckles undone, and go walking about\\nthe camp. Indeed Nelson says that the only time when Khan Sahib does not\\ncast himself adrift is when he is ready to start on the march.","image":null},{"merge":"C17.02","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The expedition is experiencing good weather and traveling over a hard surface.

Early morning._ We had a really good lie-in yesterday, and\\nafter the hard slogging with the dogs during the last few days I for one\\nwas very glad of it. We came on behind, and in sight of the mules this\\nlast march, and the change in the dogs was wonderful. Where it had been a\\njob to urge them on over quite as good a surface yesterday, to-day for\\nsome time we could not get off the sledge except for short runs: although\\nwe had taken 312 lbs. weight off the mules and loaded it on to the dogs.\\nWe had a most glorious night for marching, and it is now bright sunlight,\\nand the animals\' fur is quite warm where the sun strikes it. We have just\\nhad a bit of a fight over the dog-food, Vaida going for Dyk, and now the\\nothers are somewhat excited, and there are constant growlings and\\nmurmurings.\\nThe camp makes more of a mark than last year, for the mules are dark\\nwhile the ponies were white or grey, and the cloths are brown instead of\\nlight green. The consequence is that the camp shows up from a long\\ndistance off. We are building cairns at regular distances, and there\\nshould be no difficulty in keeping on the course in fair weather at any\\nrate. Now in the land of big sastrugi: Erebus is beginning to look small,\\nbut we could see an unusually big smoke from the crater all day.\\n_November 7. Early morning._ Not an easy day. It was -9\xb0 and overcast\\nwhen we turned out, and the wind was then dying down, but it had been\\nblowing up to force 5, with surface drift during the day. We started in a\\nbad light and the surface, which was the usual hard surface common here,\\nwith big sastrugi, was covered by a thin layer of crystals which were\\nthen falling. This naturally made it very much harder pulling: we with\\nthe dogs have been running nearly all the twelve miles, and I for one am\\ntired. At lunch Atkinson thought he saw a tent away to our right,--the\\nvery thought of it came as a shock,--but it proved to be a false alarm.\\nWe have been keeping a sharp look-out for the gear which was left about\\nthis part by the Last Return Party, but have seen no sign of it.\\nIt is now -14\xb0, but the sun is shining brightly in a clear sky, and it\\nfeels beautifully warm. It seems a very regular thing for the sky to\\ncloud over as the sun gets low towards nightfall--and directly the sun\\nbegins to rise again the clouds disappear in a most wonderful way.\\n_November 8. Early morning._ Last night\'s twelve miles was quite cold for\\nthe time of year, being -23\xb0 at lunch and now -18\xb0. But it is calm, with\\nbright sun, and this temperature feels warm. However, there are some\\nfrost-bites as a result, both Nelson and Hooper having swollen faces. The\\nsame powder and crystals have been on the surface, but we have carried\\nthe good Bluff surface so far, being now four miles beyond Bluff Dep\xf4t.\\nThis is fortunate, and to the best of my recollection we were already\\ngetting on to a soft surface at this point last summer. If so there must\\nhave been more wind here this year than last, which, according to the\\nwinter we have had, seems probable.\\nWe made up the Bluff Dep\xf4t after lunch, putting up a new flag and\\nbuilding up the cairn, leaving two cases of dog-biscuit for the returning\\ndog-teams. It is curious that the drift to leeward of the cairn, that is\\nN.N.E., was quite soft, the snow all round and the drifts on either side\\nbeing hard--exceptionally hard in fact. Why this drift should remain soft\\nwhen a drift in the same place is usually hard is difficult to explain.\\nAll is happy in the mule camp. They have given Lal a drink of water and\\nhe has started to eat, which is good news. Some of the mules seem\\nsnow-blind, and they are now all wearing their blinkers. I have just\\nheard that Gran swung the thermometer at four this morning and found it\\n-29\xb0. Nelson\'s face is a sight--his nose a mere swollen lump,\\nfrost-bitten cheeks, and his goggles have frosted him where the rims\\ntouched his face. Poor Marie!\\n_November 9. Early morning._ Twelve more miles to the good, and we must\\nconsider ourselves fortunate in still carrying on the same good surface,\\nwhich is almost if not quite as good as that of yesterday. This is the\\nonly time I have ever seen a hard surface here, not more than fifteen\\nmiles from One Ton, and it looks as if there had been much higher winds.\\nThe sastrugi, which have been facing S.W., are now beginning to run a\\nlittle more westerly. I believe this to be quite a different wind\\ncirculation from Ross Island, which as a whole gets its wind from the\\nBluff. The Bluff is, I believe, the dividing line, though big general\\nblizzards sweep over the whole, irrespective of local areas of\\ncirculation. This was amply corroborated by our journey out here last\\nautumn. Well, this is better than then--just round here we had a full\\nblizzard and -33\xb0.\\n_November 10. Early morning._ A perfect night for marching, but about\\n-20\xb0 and chilly for waiting about. The mules are going well, but Lal Khan\\nis thinning down a lot: Abdullah and Khan Sahib are also off their feed.\\nTheir original allowance of 11 lbs. oats and oilcake has been reduced to\\n9 lbs., and they are not eating this. The dogs took another 300 lbs. off\\nthem to-day, and pulled it very well. The surface has been splendidly\\nhard, which is most surprising. Wright does not think that there has been\\nan abnormal deposition of snow the last winter; he says it is about 1\xbd\\nfeet, which is much the same as last year. The mules are generally not\\nsinking in more than two inches, but in places, especially latterly, they\\nhave been in five, or six. This is the first we have had this year of\\ncrusts, and some of them to-day have been exceptionally big: two at lunch\\nmust have lasted several seconds. The dogs seem to think the devil is\\nafter them when one of these goes off, and put on a terrific spurt. It is\\ninteresting to watch them snuffing in the hoof-marks of the mules, where\\nthere is evidently some scent left. In these temperatures they are always\\nkicking their legs about at the halts. As the sun gained power this\\nmorning a thick fog came up very suddenly. I believe this is a sign of\\ngood weather.\\n[Illustration: THE DOG PARTY LEAVES HUT POINT--November 1, 1912]\\n_November 11. Early morning. One Ton Dep\xf4t._ Wright got a latitude sight\\nyesterday putting us six miles from One Ton, and our sledge-meter shows\\n5\xbe, and here we are. More frost-bite this morning, and it was pretty cold\\nstarting in a fair wind and -7\xb0 temperature. We have continued this\\nreally splendid surface, and now the sastrugi are pointing a little more\\nto the south of S.W. While there are not such big mounds, the surface\\ndoes not yet show any signs of getting bad. There were the most beautiful\\ncloud-effects as we came along--a deep black to the west, shading into\\nlong lines of grey and lemon yellow round the sun, with a vertical shaft\\nthrough them, and a bright orange horizon. Now there is a brilliant\\nparhelion. Given sun, two days here are never alike. Whatever the\\nmonotony of the Barrier may be, there is endless variety in the sky, and\\nI do not believe that anywhere in the world such beautiful colours are to\\nbe seen.\\nI had a fair panic as we came up to the dep\xf4t. I did not see that one\\nbody of the ponies had gone ahead of the others and camped, but ahead of\\nthe travelling ponies was the dep\xf4t, looking very black, and I thought\\nthat there was a tent. It would be too terrible to find that, though one\\nknew that we had done all that we could, if we had done something\\ndifferent we could have saved them.\\nAnd then we find that the provisions we left here for them in the tank\\nare soaked with paraffin. How this has happened is a mystery, but I think\\nthat the oil in the XS tin, which was very full, must have forced its way\\nout in a sudden rise of temperature in a winter blizzard, and though the\\ntin was not touching the tank, it has found its way in.\\nAltogether things seemed rather dismal, but a visit to the mules is\\ncheering, for they seem very fit as a whole and their leaders are\\ncheerful. There are three sacks of oats here--had we known it would have\\nsaved a lot of weight--but we didn\'t, and we have plenty with what we\\nhave brought, so they will be of little use to us. There is no compressed\\nfodder, which would have been very useful, for the animals which are\\nrefusing the oats would probably eat it.","image":null},{"merge":"C17.03","output":"Summary: The passage describes the discovery of Scott and his team\'s bodies in their tent after their failed journey to the South Pole.\\n\\nExcerpt 1: \\"Nor will I try and put down what there was in that tent.

It is now -16\xb0, with a slight southerly wind.\\n_Nearly mid-day. 11-12 miles south of One Ton._ We have found them--to\\nsay it has been a ghastly day cannot express it--it is too bad for words.\\nThe tent was there, about half-a-mile to the west of our course, and\\nclose to a drifted-up cairn of last year. It was covered with snow and\\nlooked just like a cairn, only an extra gathering of snow showing where\\nthe ventilator was, and so we found the door.\\nIt was drifted up some 2-3 feet to windward. Just by the side two pairs\\nof ski sticks, or the topmost half of them, appeared over the snow, and a\\nbamboo which proved to be the mast of the sledge.\\nTheir story I am not going to try and put down. They got to this point on\\nMarch 21, and on the 29th all was over.\\nNor will I try and put down what there was in that tent. Scott lay in the\\ncentre, Bill on his left, with his head towards the door, and Birdie on\\nhis right, lying with his feet towards the door.\\nBill especially had died very quietly with his hands folded over his\\nchest. Birdie also quietly.\\nOates\' death was a very fine one. We go on to-morrow to try and find his\\nbody. He was glad that his regiment would be proud of him.\\nThey reached the Pole a month after Amundsen.\\nWe have everything--records, diaries, etc. They have among other things\\nseveral rolls of photographs, a meteorological log kept up to March 13,\\nand, considering all things, a great many geological specimens. _And they\\nhave stuck to everything._ It is magnificent that men in such case should\\ngo on pulling everything that they have died to gain. I think they\\nrealized their coming end a long time before. By Scott\'s head was\\ntobacco: there is also a bag of tea.\\nAtkinson gathered every one together and read to them the account of\\nOates\' death given in Scott\'s Diary: Scott expressly states that he\\nwished it known. His (Scott\'s) last words are:\\n\\"For God\'s sake take care of our people.\\"\\nThen Atkinson read the lesson from the Burial Service from Corinthians.\\nPerhaps it has never been read in a more magnificent cathedral and under\\nmore impressive circumstances--for it is a grave which kings must envy.\\nThen some prayers from the Burial Service: and there with the floor-cloth\\nunder them and the tent above we buried them in their sleeping-bags--and\\nsurely their work has not been in vain.[291]\\nThat scene can never leave my memory. We with the dogs had seen Wright\\nturn away from the course by himself and the mule party swerve\\nright-handed ahead of us. He had seen what he thought was a cairn, and\\nthen something looking black by its side. A vague kind of wonder\\ngradually gave way to a real alarm. We came up to them all halted. Wright\\ncame across to us. \'It is the tent.\' I do not know how he knew. Just a\\nwaste of snow: to our right the remains of one of last year\'s cairns, a\\nmere mound: and then three feet of bamboo sticking quite alone out of the\\nsnow: and then another mound, of snow, perhaps a trifle more pointed. We\\nwalked up to it. I do not think we quite realized--not for very long--but\\nsome one reached up to a projection of snow, and brushed it away. The\\ngreen flap of the ventilator of the tent appeared, and we knew that the\\ndoor was below.\\nTwo of us entered, through the funnel of the outer tent, and through the\\nbamboos on which was stretched the lining of the inner tent. There was\\nsome snow--not much--between the two linings. But inside we could see\\nnothing--the snow had drifted out the light. There was nothing to do but\\nto dig the tent out. Soon we could see the outlines. There were three men\\nhere.\\nBowers and Wilson were sleeping in their bags. Scott had thrown back the\\nflaps of his bag at the end. His left hand was stretched over Wilson, his\\nlifelong friend. Beneath the head of his bag, between the bag and the\\nfloor-cloth, was the green wallet in which he carried his diary. The\\nbrown books of diary were inside: and on the floor-cloth were some\\nletters.\\nEverything was tidy. The tent had been pitched as well as ever, with the\\ndoor facing down the sastrugi, the bamboos with a good spread, the tent\\nitself taut and shipshape. There was no snow inside the inner lining.\\nThere were some loose pannikins from the cooker, the ordinary tent gear,\\nthe personal belongings and a few more letters and records--personal and\\nscientific. Near Scott was a lamp formed from a tin and some lamp wick\\noff a finnesko. It had been used to burn the little methylated spirit\\nwhich remained. I think that Scott had used it to help him to write up to\\nthe end. I feel sure that he had died last--and once I had thought that\\nhe would not go so far as some of the others. We never realized how\\nstrong that man was, mentally and physically, until now.\\nWe sorted out the gear, records, papers, diaries, spare clothing,\\nletters, chronometers, finnesko, socks, a flag. There was even a book\\nwhich I had lent Bill for the journey--and he had brought it back.\\nSomehow we learnt that Amundsen had been to the Pole, and that they too\\nhad been to the Pole, and both items of news seemed to be of no\\nimportance whatever. There was a letter there from Amundsen to King\\nHaakon. There were the personal chatty little notes we had left for them\\non the Beardmore--how much more important to us than all the royal\\nletters in the world.\\nWe dug down the bamboo which had brought us to this place. It led to the\\nsledge, many feet down, and had been rigged there as a mast. And on the\\nsledge were some more odds and ends--a piece of paper from the biscuit\\nbox: Bowers\' meteorological log: and the geological specimens, thirty\\npounds of them, all of the first importance. Drifted over also were the\\nharnesses, ski and ski-sticks.\\nHour after hour, so it seemed to me, Atkinson sat in our tent and read.\\nThe finder was to read the diary and then it was to be brought\\nhome--these were Scott\'s instructions written on the cover. But Atkinson\\nsaid he was only going to read sufficient to know what had happened--and\\nafter that they were brought home unopened and unread. When he had the\\noutline we all gathered together and he read to us the Message to the\\nPublic, and the account of Oates\' death, which Scott had expressly wished\\nto be known.\\nWe never moved them. We took the bamboos of the tent away, and the tent\\nitself covered them. And over them we built the cairn.\\nI do not know how long we were there, but when all was finished, and the\\nchapter of Corinthians had been read, it was midnight of some day. The\\nsun was dipping low above the Pole, the Barrier was almost in shadow. And\\nthe sky was blazing--sheets and sheets of iridescent clouds. The cairn\\nand Cross stood dark against a glory of burnished gold.\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n_Copy of Note left at the Cairn, over the Bodies_\\n    _November 12th, 1912._\\n            Lat. 79\xb0 50\xb4 S.","image":null},{"merge":"C17.04","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The passage describes the erection of a cross and cairn in memory of Captain Scott, Dr. Wilson, and Lt.

That we can make anything that will be permanent on this Barrier\\nis impossible, but as far as a lasting mark can be made it has been done.\\nOn this a cross has been fixed, made out of ski. On either side are the\\ntwo sledges, fixed upright and dug in.\\nThe whole is very simple and most impressive.\\nOn a bamboo standing by itself is left the record which I have copied\\ninto this book, and which has been signed by us all.\\nWe shall leave some provisions here, and go on lightly laden to see if we\\ncan find Titus Oates\' body: and so give it what burial we can.\\nWe start in about an hour, and I for one shall be glad to leave this\\nplace.\\nI am very very sorry that this question of the shortage of oil has\\narisen. We in the First Return Party were most careful with our\\nmeasurement--having a ruler of Wright\'s and a piece of bamboo with which\\nwe did it: measuring the total height of oil in each case, and then\\ndividing up the stick accordingly with the ruler: and we were _always_\\ncareful to take _a little less than we were entitled to_, which was\\nstated to me, and stated by Birdie in his dep\xf4t notes, to be one-third of\\neverything in the dep\xf4t.\\nHow the shortage arose is a mystery. And they eleven miles from One Ton\\nand plenty!\\nTitus did not show his foot till about three days before he died. The\\nfoot was then a great size, and almost every night it would be\\nfrost-bitten again. Then the last day at lunch he said he could go on no\\nmore--but they said he must: he wanted them to leave him behind in his\\nbag. That night he turned in, hoping never to wake: but he woke, and then\\nhe asked their advice: they said they must all go on together. A thick\\nblizzard was blowing, and he said, after a bit, \\"Well, I am just going\\noutside, and I may be some time.\\" They searched for him but could not\\nfind him.\\nThey had a terrible time from 80\xb0 30\xb4 on to their last camp. There Bill\\nwas very bad, and Birdie and the Owner had to do the camping.\\nAnd then, eleven miles from plenty, they had _nine days of blizzard, and\\nthat was the end._\\nThey had a good spread on their tent, and their ski-sticks were standing,\\nbut their ski were drifted up on the ground.\\nThe tent was in excellent condition--only down some of the poles there\\nwere some chafes.\\nThey had been trying a spirit lamp when all the oil was gone.\\nAt 88\xb0 or so they were getting temperatures from -20\xb0 to -30\xb0. At 82\xb0,\\n10,000 feet lower, it was regularly down to -47\xb0 in the night-time, and\\n-30\xb0 during the day: for no explainable reason.\\nBill\'s and Birdie\'s feet got bad--the Owner\'s feet got bad last.\\nIt is all too horrible--I am almost afraid to go to sleep now.\\n_November 13. Early morning._ We came on just under seven miles with a\\nvery cold moist wind hurting our faces all the way. We have left most of\\nthe provisions to pick up again. We purpose going on thirteen miles\\nto-morrow and search for Oates\' body, and then turn back and get the\\nprovisions back to Hut Point and see what can be done over in the west to\\nget up that coast.\\nWe hope to get two mules back to Hut Point. If possible, we want to\\ncommunicate with Cape Evans.\\nAtkinson has been quite splendid in this very trying time.\\n_November 14. Early morning._ It has been a miserable march. We had to\\nwait some time after hoosh to let the mules get ahead. Then we went on in\\na cold raw fog and some head wind, with constant frost-bites. The surface\\nhas been very bad all day for the thirteen miles: if we had been walking\\nin arrowroot it would have been much like this was. At lunch the\\ntemperature was -14.7\xb0.\\nThen on when it was drifting with the wind in our faces and in a bad\\nlight. What we took to be the mule party ahead proved to be the old pony\\nwalls 26 miles from One Ton. There was here a bit of sacking on the\\ncairn, and Oates\' bag. Inside the bag was the theodolite, and his\\nfinnesko and socks. One of the finnesko was slit down the front as far as\\nthe leather beckets, evidently to get his bad foot into it. This was\\nfifteen miles from the last camp, and I suppose they had brought on his\\nbag for three or four miles in case they might find him still alive.\\nHalf-a-mile from our last camp there was a very large and quite\\nunmistakable undulation, one-quarter to one-third of a mile from crest to\\ncrest: the pony walls behind us disappeared almost as soon as we started\\nto go down, and reappeared again on the other side. There were, I feel\\nsure, other rolls, but this was the largest. We have seen no sign of\\nOates\' body.\\nAbout half an hour ago it started to blow a blizzard, and it is now\\nthick, but the wind is not strong. The mules, which came along well\\nconsidering the surface, are off their feed, and this may be the reason.\\nDimitri saw the Cairn with the Cross more than eight miles away this\\nmorning, and in a good light it would be seen from much farther off.\\n_November 15. Early morning._ We built a cairn to mark the spot near\\nwhich Oates walked out to his death, and we placed a cross on it. Lashed\\nto the cross is a record, as follows:\\n    Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain L. E. G. Oates\\n    of the Inniskilling Dragoons. In March 1912, returning from the\\n    Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard to try and\\n    save his comrades, beset by hardship. This note is left by the\\n    Relief Expedition. 1912.\\nThis was signed by Atkinson and myself.\\nWe saw the cairn for a long way in a bad light as we came back to-day.\\nThe original plan with which we started from Cape Evans was, if the Party\\nwas found where we could still bear out sufficiently to the eastward to\\nhave a good chance of missing the pressure caused by the Beardmore, to go\\non and do what we could to survey the land south of the Beardmore: for\\nthis was the original plan of Captain Scott for this year\'s sledging. But\\nas things are I do not think there can be much doubt that we are doing\\nright in losing no time in going over to the west of McMurdo Sound to see\\nwhether we can go up to Evans Coves, and help Campbell and his party.\\nWe brought on Oates\' bag. The theodolite was inside.\\nA thickish blizzard blew all day yesterday, but it was clear and there\\nwas only surface drift when we turned out for the night march. Then again\\nas we came along, the sky became overcast--all except over the land,\\nwhich remains clear these nights when everything else is obscured. We\\nnoticed the same thing last year. Now the wind, which had largely\\ndropped, has started again and it is drifting. We have had wind and drift\\non four out of the last five days.\\n_November 16. Early morning._ When we were ready to start with the dogs\\nit was blowing a thick blizzard, but the mules had already started some\\ntime, when it was not thick. We had to wait until nearly 4 A.M. before we\\ncould start, and came along following tracks. It is very warm and the\\nsurface is covered with loose snow, but the slide in it seems good. We\\nfound the mules here at the Cairn and Cross, having been able to find\\ntheir way partly by the old tracks.\\nI have been trying to draw the grave. Of all the fine monuments in the\\nworld none seems to me more fitting; and it is also most impressive.","image":null},{"merge":"C17.05","output":"Summary: The team abandons a plan to cross the plateau to Evans Coves and is traveling through thick snowy weather.

Early morning._ I think we are all going crazy together--at\\nany rate things are pretty difficult. The latest scheme is to try and\\nfind a way over the plateau to Evans Coves, trying to strike the top of a\\nglacier and go down it. There can be no good in it: if ever men did it,\\nthey would arrive about the time the ship arrived there too, and their\\nlabour would be in vain. If they got there and the ship did not arrive,\\nthere is another party stranded. They would have to wait till February 15\\nor 20 to see if the ship was coming, and then there would be no\\ntravelling back over the plateau: even if we could do it those men there\\ncould not.\\nIt was almost oppressively hot yesterday--but I\'ll never grumble about\\nheat again. It has now cleared a lot and we came along on the cairns\\neasily--but on a very soft downy surface, and the travelling has not been\\nfast. We bring with us the Southern Party\'s gear. The sledge, which was\\nthe 10-foot which they brought on from the bottom of the glacier, has\\nbeen left.\\n_November 18. Early morning._ I am thankful to say that the plateau\\njourney idea has been given up.\\nOnce more we have come along in thick, snowy weather. If we had not men\\non ski to steer we could never keep much of a course, but Wright is\\nsteering us very straight, keeping a check on the course by watching the\\nman behind, and so far we have been picking up all the cairns. This\\nmorning we passed the pony walls made on November 10. And yet they were\\nnearly level with the ground; so they are not much of a mark. Yank has\\njust had a disagreement with Kusoi--for Kusoi objected to his trying to\\nget at the meat on the sledge. The mules have been sinking in a long way,\\nand are marching very slowly. Pyaree eats the tea-leaves after meals:\\nRani and Abdullah divide a rope between them at the halts; and they have\\neaten the best part of a trace since our last camp. These animals eat\\nanything but their proper food, and this some of them will hardly touch.\\nIt cleared a bit for our second march, and we have done our 13 miles, but\\nit was very slow travelling. Now it is drifting as much as ever. Yank,\\nthat redoubtable puller, has just eaten himself loose for the third time\\nsince hoosh. This time I had to go down to the pony walls to get him.\\nWe have had onions for the first time to-night in our hoosh--they are\\nmost excellent. Also we have been having some Nestl\xe9\'s condensed milk\\nfrom One Ton Dep\xf4t--which I do not want to see again, the dep\xf4t I mean.\\nPeary must know what he is about, taking milk as a ration: the sweetness\\nis a great thing, but it would be heavy: we have been having it with\\ntemperature down to -14\xb0, when it was quite manageable, but I don\'t know\\nwhat it would be like in colder temperatures.\\n_November 19. Early morning._ We have done our 13 miles to-day and have\\ngot on to a much better surface. By what we and others have seen before,\\nit seems that last winter must have generally been an exceptional one.\\nThere have been many parties out here: we have never before seen this\\nwind-swept surface, on which it is often too slippery to walk\\ncomfortably. I do not know what temperatures the Discovery had in April,\\nbut it was much colder last April than it was the year before. And then\\nnothing had been experienced down here to compare with the winds last\\nwinter.\\nThere was a high wind and a lot of drift yesterday during the day, and\\nnow it is blowing and drifting as usual. During the last nine days there\\nhas only been one, the day we found the tent, when it has not been\\ndrifting during all or part of the day. It is all right for travelling\\nnorth, but we should be having very uncomfortable marches if we were\\nmarching the other way.\\n_November 20. Early morning._ To-day we have seemed to be walking in\\ncircles through space. Wright, by dint of having a man behind to give him\\na fixed point to steer upon, has steered us quite straight, and we have\\npicked up every cairn. The pony party camped for lunch by two cairns, but\\nthey never knew the two cairns were there until a piece of paper blew\\naway and had to be fetched: and it was caught against one of the cairns.\\nThey left a flag there to guide us, and though we saw and brought along\\nthe flag, we never saw the cairns. The temperature is -22.5\xb0, and it is\\nnow blowing a full blizzard. All this snow has hitherto been lying on the\\nground and making a very soft surface, for though the wind has always\\nbeen blowing it has never been very strong. This snow and wind, which\\nhave now persisted for nine out of the last ten days, make most\\ndispiriting marches; for there is nothing to see, and finding tracks or\\nsteering is a constant strain. We are certainly lucky to have been able\\nto march as we have.\\n_Note on Mules._--The most ardent admirer of mules could not say that\\nthey were a success. The question is whether they might be made so. There\\nwas really only one thing against them but that is a very important\\none--they would not eat on the Barrier. From the time they went away to\\nthe day they returned (those that did return, poor things) they starved\\nthemselves, and yet they pulled biggish loads for 30 days.\\nIf they would have eaten they would have been a huge success. They\\ntravelled faster than the ponies and, with one exception, kept together\\nbetter than the ponies. If both were eating their ration it is\\nquestionable whether a good mule or a good pony is to be preferred. Our\\nmules were of the best, and they were beautifully trained and equipped by\\nthe Indian Government: yet on November 13, a fortnight from the start,\\nWright records, \\"mules are a poor substitute for ponies. Not many will\\nsee Hut Point again, I think. Doubt if any would have got much farther\\nthan this if surfaces had been as bad this year as last.\\"[292]\\nThough they would not eat oats, compressed fodder and oil-cake, they were\\nquite willing to eat all kinds of other things. If we could have arrived\\nat the mule equivalent to a vegetarian diet they might have pulled to the\\nBeardmore without stopping. The nearest to this diet at which we could\\narrive was saennegrass, tea-leaves, tobacco ash and rope--all of which\\nwere eaten with gusto. But supplies were very limited. They ate\\ndog-biscuit as long as they thought we were not looking--but as soon as\\nthey realized they were meant to eat it they went on hunger-strike again.\\nBut during halts at cairns Rani and Pyaree would stand solemnly chewing\\nthe same piece of rope from different ends. Abdullah always led the line,\\nand followed Wright\'s ski tracks faithfully, so that if another man was\\nahead and Wright turned aside Abdullah always turned too. It was quite a\\nmanoeuvre for Wright to read the sledge-meter at the back of the\\nsledge. As for Begum: \\"Got Begum out of a soft patch by rolling her\\nover.\\"[293]\\nOn the whole the mules failed to adapt themselves to this life, and as\\nsuch must at present be considered to be a failure for Antarctic work.\\nCertainly those of our ponies which had the best chance to adapt\\nthemselves went farthest, such as Nobby and Jimmy Pigg, both of whom had\\nexperience of Barrier sledging before they started on the Polar Journey.\\n_November 21. Early morning._ It has cleared at last, the disturbance\\nrolling away to the east during our first march. The surface was very bad\\nand the mules were not going well. At this time last year many of the\\nponies were still quite difficult to make stand just before starting. But\\nthese mules start off now most dolefully. I am afraid they will not all\\nget back to Hut Point.\\nTwo and a half miles after lunch, i.e. just over forty miles from the\\ndep\xf4t, we turned out to the eastward and found the gear left by the\\nSecond Return Party, when Evans was so ill. The theodolite, which\\nbelonged to Evans, is I believe there, but though we dug all round we\\nwere unable to find it. The ski were all upright, drifted to within six\\ninches of the shoes. Most of the gear was clothing, which we have left,\\nwith the skis, in the tank. We brought on a roll of Birdie\'s photographs,\\ntaken on the plateau, and three geological specimens: deep-seated rocks I\\nthink. This was all of importance that there was there.\\nThe N Ration, which we have now come to, consists of about 40 oz. of\\nfood. At present, doing the work we are doing, and with these high\\ntemperatures, -23\xb0 when we started, for instance, and -17\xb0 now, the men\\ndo not want it. For what it was intended for, hard man-hauling, it would\\nprobably be an excellent ration, and very satisfying.","image":null},{"merge":"C17.06","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The team continues their journey toward Cape Evans, encountering hungry dogs and deteriorating cairns.

The pony walls are\\ndrifted level--huge drifts, quite hard, running up to windward and down\\nto lee.\\nThe dogs are getting more hungry, and want to get at the mules, which\\nmakes them go better. They went very well to-day, but too fast once, for\\nwe had a general mix-up: Bieliglass under the sledge and the rest all\\ntangled up and ready for a fight at the first chance. How one of the\\nfront pair of dogs got under the sledge is a mystery.\\nAmong the Polar Party\'s gear is a letter to the King of Norway. It was\\nleft by the Norwegians for Scott to take back. It is wrapped in a piece\\nof thin windcloth with one dark check line in it. Coarser and rougher\\nand, I should say, heavier than our Mandelbergs.\\n_November 23. Early morning._ We were to make Dimitri Dep\xf4t this morning,\\nbut we came on in a fog, and the mule party camped after running down the\\ndistance. Wright came back and said, \\"If we have passed it, it\'s over\\nthere\\"--and as he pointed the dep\xf4t showed--not more than 200 yards away.\\nSo that is all right. We, the dog party, go on in advance to-morrow, so\\nthat no time may be lost, and if the ice is still good, Atkinson will get\\nover to Cape Evans.\\n[Illustration: \'ATCH\']\\n[Illustration: TITUS OATES]\\n_November 24. Early morning._ A glut of foot-walloping in soft snow and\\nbreaking crusts. We have done between 17 and 18 miles to-day. We saw no\\ncrevasses, and have marked the course well, building up the cairns and\\nleaving two flags--so the mule party should be all right. The dogs were\\ngoing well behind the ponies, but directly we went ahead they seemed to\\nlose heart. I think they are tired of the Barrier: a cairn now awakens\\nlittle interest: they know it is only a mark and it does not mean a\\ncamp: they are all well fed, and fairly fat and in good condition. With a\\nlarge number of dogs I suppose one team can go ahead when it is going\\nwell--changing places with another--each keeping the others going. But I\\ndo not think that these dogs now will do much more; but they have already\\ndone as much as any dogs of which we have any record.\\nThe land is clearing gradually. I have never seen such contrasts of black\\nrock and white snow, and White Island was capped with great ranges of\\nblack cumulus, over which rose the pure white peaks of the Royal Society\\nRange in a blue sky. The Barrier itself was quite a deep grey, making a\\nbeautiful picture. And now Observation Hill and Castle Rock are in front.\\nI don\'t suppose I shall ever see this view again: but it is associated\\nwith many memories of returning to home and plenty after some long and\\nhard journeys: in some ways I feel sorry--but I have seen it often\\nenough.\\n_November 25. Early morning._ We came in 24 miles with our loads, to find\\nthe best possible news--Campbell\'s Party, all well, are at Cape Evans.\\nThey arrived here on November 6, starting from Evans Coves on September\\n30. What a relief it is, and how different things seem now! It is the\\nfirst real bit of good news since February last--it seems an age. We mean\\nto get over the sea-ice, if possible, as soon as we can, and then we\\nshall hear their story.\\n_November 26. Early morning._ Starting from Hut Point about 6.45 P.M.\\nlast evening, we came through by about 9 P.M., and sat up talking and\\nhearing all the splendid news till past 2 A.M. this morning.\\nAll the Northern Party look very fat and fit, and they are most cheerful\\nabout the time they have had, and make light of all the anxious days they\\nmust have spent and their hard times.\\nI cannot write all their story. When the ship was battling with the pack\\nto try and get in to them they had open water in Terra Nova Bay to the\\nhorizon, as seen from 200 feet high. They prepared for the winter,\\ndigging their hut into a big snowdrift a mile from where they were\\nlanded. They thought that the ship had been wrecked--or that every one\\nhad been taken off from here, and that then the ship had been blown north\\nby a succession of furious gales which they had and could not get back.\\nThey never considered seriously the possibility of sledging down the\\ncoast before the winter. They got settled in and were very warm--so warm\\nthat in August they did away with one door, of which they had three, of\\nbiscuit boxes and sacking.\\nTheir stove was the bottom of an oil tin, and they cooked by dripping\\nblubber on to seal bones, which became soaked with the blubber, and\\nCampbell tells me they cooked almost as quickly as a primus. Of course\\nthey were filthy. Their main difficulty was dysentery and ptomaine\\npoisoning.\\nTheir stories of the winter are most amusing--of \\"Placing the Plug, or\\nSports in the Antarctic\\"; of lectures; of how dirty they were; of their\\nbooks, of which they had four, including David Copperfield. They had a\\nspare tent, which was lucky, for the bamboos of one of theirs were blown\\nin during a big wind, and the men inside it crept along the piedmont on\\nhands and knees to the igloo and slept two in a bag. How the seal seemed\\nas if they would give out, and they were on half rations and very hungry:\\nand they were thinking they would have to come down in the winter, when\\nthey got two seals: of the fish they got from the stomach of a seal--\\"the\\nbest feed they had\\"--the blubber they have eaten.\\nBut they were buried deep in the snow and quite warm. Big winds all the\\ntime from the W.S.W., cold winds off the plateau--in the igloo they could\\nhear almost nothing outside--how they just had a biscuit a day at times,\\nsugar on Sundays, etc.\\nAnd so all is well in this direction, and we have done right in going\\nsouth, and we have at least succeeded in getting all records. I suppose\\nany news is better than no news.\\n_Evening._ The Pole Party photos of themselves at the Pole and at the\\nNorwegian cairn (a Norwegian tent, post and two flags) are very good\\nindeed--one film is unused, one used on these two subjects: taken with\\nBirdie\'s camera. All the party look fit and well, and their clothes are\\nnot iced up. It was calm at the time: the surface looks rather soft.\\nAtkinson and Campbell have gone to Hut Point with one dog-team, and we\\nare all to forgather here. The ice still seems good from here to Hut\\nPoint: all else open water as far as can be seen.\\nA steady southerly wind has been blowing here for three days now. The\\nmules should get into Hut Point to-day.\\nIt is the happiest day for nearly a year--almost the only happy one.\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n   [291] My own diary.\\n   [292] Wright\'s diary.\\n   [293] Wright\'s diary.\\n\\n\\n","image":null},{"merge":"C18.01","output":"The passage describes the composition of the five-man Polar Party, highlighting their skills and experience, as well as some of the disadvantages of having an extra man.

Four of them were men who were accustomed to take responsibility\\nand to lead others. Four of them had wide sledging experience and were\\naccustomed to cold temperatures. They were none of them likely to get\\nflurried in emergency, to panic under any circumstances, or to wear\\nthemselves out by loss of nervous control. Scott and Wilson were the most\\nhighly strung of the party: I believe that the anxiety which Scott\\nsuffered served as a stimulus against mental monotony rather than as a\\ndrain upon his energy. Scott was 43, Wilson 39, Evans 37, Oates 32, and\\nBowers 28 years old. Bowers was exceptionally old for his age.\\nIn the event of one man crocking a five-man party may be better able to\\ncope with the situation, but with this doubtful exception Scott had\\nnothing to gain and a good deal to lose by taking an extra man to the\\nPole. That he did so means, I think, that he considered his position a\\nvery good one at this time. He was anxious to take as many men with him\\nas possible. I have an impression that he wanted the army represented as\\nwell as the navy. Be that as it may, he took five men: he decided to take\\nthe extra man at the last moment, and in doing so he added one more link\\nto a chain. But he was content; and four days after the Last Return Party\\nleft them, as he lay out a blizzard, quite warm in his sleeping-bag\\nthough the mid-day temperature was -20\xb0, he wrote a long diary praising\\nhis companions very highly indeed \\"so our five people are perhaps as\\nhappily selected as it is possible to imagine.\\"[294] He speaks of Seaman\\nEvans as being a giant worker with a really remarkable headpiece. There\\nis no mention of the party feeling the cold, though they were now at the\\ngreatest height of their journey; the food satisfied them thoroughly.\\nThere is no shadow of trouble here: only Evans has got a nasty cut on his\\nhand!\\nThere were more disadvantages in this five-man party than you might\\nthink. There was 5\xbd weeks\' food for four men: five men would eat this in\\nabout four weeks. In addition to the extra risk of breakdown, there was\\na certain amount of discomfort involved, for everything was arranged for\\nfour men as I have already explained; the tent was a four-man tent, and\\nan inner lining had been lashed to the bamboos making it smaller still:\\nwhen stretched out for the night the sleeping-bags of the two outside men\\nmust have been partly off the floor-cloth, and probably on the snow:\\ntheir bags must have been touching the inner tent and collecting the rime\\nwhich was formed there: cooking for five took about half an hour longer\\nin the day than cooking for four--half an hour off your sleep, or half an\\nhour off your march? I do not believe that five men on the lid of a\\ncrevasse are as safe as four. Wilson writes that the stow of the sledge\\nwith five sleeping-bags was pretty high: this makes it top-heavy and\\nliable to capsize in rough country.\\nBut what would have paralysed anybody except Bowers was the fact that\\nthey had only four pairs of ski between the five of them. To slog along\\non foot, in soft snow, in the middle of four men pulling rhythmically on\\nski, must have been tiring and even painful; and Birdie\'s legs were very\\nshort. No steady swing for him, and little chance of getting his mind off\\nthe job in hand. Scott could never have meant to take on five men when he\\ntold his supporting team to leave their ski behind, only four days before\\nhe reorganized.\\n\\"May I be there!\\" wrote Wilson of the men chosen to travel the ice-cap to\\nthe Pole. \\"About this time next year may I be there or thereabouts! With\\nso many young bloods in the heyday of youth and strength beyond my own I\\nfeel there will be a most difficult task in making choice towards the\\nend.\\" \\"I should like to have Bill to hold my hand when we get to the\\nPole,\\" said Scott.\\nWilson _was_ there and his diary is that of an artist, watching the\\nclouds and mountains, of a scientist observing ice and rock and snow, of\\na doctor, and above all of a man with good judgment. You will understand\\nthat the thing which really interested him in this journey was the\\nacquisition of knowledge. It is a restrained, and for the most part a\\nsimple, record of facts. There is seldom any comment, and when there is\\nyou feel that, for this very reason, it carries more weight. Just about\\nthis time: \\"December 24. Very promising, thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon\\nmarch\\": \\"Christmas Day, and a real good and happy one with a very long\\nmarch\\": \\"January 1, 1912. We had only 6 hours\' sleep last night by a\\nmistake, but I had mine solid in one piece, actually waking in exactly\\nthe same position as I fell asleep in 6 hours before--never moved\\":\\n\\"January 2. We were surprised to-day by seeing a Skua gull flying over\\nus--evidently hungry but not weak. Its droppings, however, were clear\\nmucus, nothing in them at all. It appeared in the afternoon and\\ndisappeared again about \xbd hour after.\\" And then on January 3: \\"Last night\\nScott told us what the plans were for the South Pole. Scott, Oates,\\nBowers, Petty Officer Evans and I are to go to the Pole. Teddie Evans is\\nto return from here to-morrow with Crean and Lashly. Scott finished his\\nweek\'s cooking to-night and I begin mine to-morrow.\\" Just that.\\nThe next day Bowers wrote: \\"I had my farewell breakfast in the tent with\\nTeddy Evans, Crean and Lashly. After so little sleep the previous night I\\nrather dreaded the march. We gave our various notes, messages and letters\\nto the returning party and started off. They accompanied us for about a\\nmile before returning, to see that all was going well. Our party were on\\nski with the exception of myself: I first made fast to the central span,\\nbut afterwards connected up to the toggle of the sledge, pulling in the\\ncentre between the inner ends of Captain Scott\'s and Dr. Wilson\'s traces.\\nThis was found to be the best place, as I had to go my own step.","image":null},{"merge":"C18.02","output":"[The passage describes the daily routine of the explorers on their journey to the South Pole, and the difficult conditions they face due to the changing surfaces and cold temperature.

It is a long slog with a well-loaded\\nsledge, and more tiring for me than the others, as I have no ski.\\nHowever, as long as I can do my share all day and keep fit it does not\\nmatter much one way or the other.\\n\\"We had our first northerly wind on the plateau to-day, and a deposit of\\nsnow crystals made the surface like sand latterly on the march. The\\nsledge dragged like lead. In the evening it fell calm, and although the\\ntemperature was -16\xb0 it was positively pleasant to stand about outside\\nthe tent and bask in the sun\'s rays. It was our first calm since we\\nreached the summit too. Our socks and other damp articles which we hang\\nout to dry at night become immediately covered with long feathery\\ncrystals exactly like plumes.

On the whole he is\\nenjoying himself, I think.\\nYou should read Scott\'s diary yourself and form your own opinions, but I\\nthink that after the Last Return Party left him there is a load off his\\nmind. The thing had worked so far, it was up to _them_ now: that great\\nmass of figures and weights and averages, those years of preparation,\\nthose months of anxiety--no one of them had been in vain. They were up\\nto date in distance, and there was a very good amount of food, probably\\nmore than was necessary to see them to the Pole and off the plateau on\\nfull rations. Best thought of all, perhaps, the motors with their\\nuncertainties, the ponies with their suffering, the glacier with its\\npossibilities of disaster, all were behind: and the two main supporting\\nparties were safely on their way home. Here with him was a fine party,\\ntested and strong, and only 148 miles from the Pole.\\nI can see them, working with a business-like air, with no fuss and no\\nunnecessary talk, each man knowing his job and doing it: pitching the\\ntent: finishing the camp work and sitting round on their sleeping-bags\\nwhile their meal was cooked: warming their hands on their mugs: saving a\\nbiscuit to eat when they woke in the night: packing the sledge with a\\ngood neat stow: marching with a solid swing--we have seen them do it so\\noften, and they did it jolly well.\\nAnd the conditions did not seem so bad. \\"To-night it is flat calm; the\\nsun so warm that in spite of the temperature we can stand about outside\\nin the greatest comfort. It is amusing to stand thus and remember the\\nconstant horrors of our situation as they were painted for us: the sun is\\nmelting the snow on the ski, etc. The plateau is now very flat, but we\\nare still ascending slowly. The sastrugi are getting more confused,\\npredominant from the S.E. I wonder what is in store for us. At present\\neverything seems to be going with extraordinary smoothness.... We feel\\nthe cold very little, the great comfort of our situation is the excellent\\ndrying effect of the sun.... Our food continues to amply satisfy. What\\nluck to have hit on such an excellent ration. We really are an\\nexcellently found party ... we lie so very comfortably, warmly clothed in\\nour comfortable bags, within our double-walled tent.\\"[297]\\nThen something happened.\\nWhile Scott was writing the sentences you have just read, he reached the\\nsummit of the plateau and started, ever so slightly, to go downhill. The\\nlist of corrected altitudes given by Simpson in his meteorological\\nreport are of great interest: Cape Evans 0, Shambles Camp 170, Upper\\nGlacier Dep\xf4t 7151, Three Degree Dep\xf4t 9392, One and a Half Degree Dep\xf4t\\n9862, South Pole 9072 feet above sea-level.[298]\\nWhat happened is not quite clear, but there is no doubt that the surface\\nbecame very bad, that the party began to feel the cold, and that before\\nlong Evans especially began to crock. The immediate trouble was bad\\nsurfaces. I will try and show why these surfaces should have been met in\\nwhat was, you must remember, now a land which no man had travelled\\nbefore.\\nScott laid his One and a Half Degree Dep\xf4t (i.e. 1\xbd\xb0 or 90 miles from\\nthe Pole) on January 10. That day they started to go down, but for\\nseveral days before that the plateau had been pretty flat. Time after\\ntime in the diaries you find crystals--crystals--crystals: crystals\\nfalling through the air, crystals bearding the sastrugi, crystals lying\\nloose upon the snow. Sandy crystals, upon which the sun shines and which\\nmade pulling a terrible effort: when the sky clouds over they get along\\nmuch better. The clouds form and disperse without visible reason. And\\ngenerally the wind is in their faces.\\nWright tells me that there is certain evidence in the records which may\\nexplain these crystals. Halos are caused by crystals and nearly all those\\nlogged from the bottom of the Beardmore to the Pole and back were on this\\nstretch of country, where the land was falling. Bowers mentions that the\\ncrystals did not appear in all directions, which goes to show that the\\nair was not always rising, but sometimes was falling and therefore not\\ndepositing its moisture. There is no doubt that the surfaces met were\\nvery variable, and it may be that the snow lay in waves. Bowers mentions\\nbig undulations for thirty miles before the Pole, and other inequalities\\nmay have been there which were not visible. There is sometimes evidence\\nthat these crystals were formed on the windward side of these waves, and\\ncarried over by a strong wind and deposited on the lee side.\\nIt is common knowledge that as you rise in the atmosphere so the pressure\\ndecreases: in fact, it is usual to measure your height by reading the\\nbarometer. Now the air on this last stretch to the Pole was rising, for\\nthe wind was from the south, and, as we have seen, the plateau here was\\nsloping down towards the Pole. The air, driven uphill by this southerly\\nwind, was forced to rise. As it rose it expanded, because the pressure\\nwas less. Air which has expanded without any heat being given to it from\\noutside, that is in a heat-proof vessel, is said to expand by adiabatic\\nexpansion. Such air tends first to become saturated, and then to\\nprecipitate its moisture. These conditions were approximately fulfilled\\non the plateau, where the air expanded as it rose, but could get little\\nor no heat from outside. The air therefore precipitated its moisture in\\nthe form of crystals.","image":null},{"merge":"C18.03","output":"This passage describes Scott\'s expedition towards the South Pole, discussing their physical and environmental struggles along the way.

Little Bowers is wonderful; in spite of my protest\\nhe _would_ take sights after we had camped to-night, after marching in\\nthe soft snow all day when we have been comparatively restful on\\nski.\\"[299] On January 14, Wilson wrote: \\"A very cold grey thick day with\\na persistent breeze from the S.S.E. which we all felt considerably, but\\ntemperature was only -18\xb0 at lunch and -15\xb0 in the evening. Now just over\\n40 miles from the Pole.\\" Scott wrote the same day: \\"Again we noticed the\\ncold; at lunch to-day all our feet were cold but this was mainly due to\\nthe bald state of our finnesko. I put some grease under the bare skin and\\nfound it make all the difference. Oates seems to be feeling the cold and\\nfatigue more than the rest of us, but we are all very fit.\\" And on\\nJanuary 15, lunch: \\"We were all pretty done at camping.\\"[300] And Wilson:\\n\\"We made a dep\xf4t [The Last Dep\xf4t] of provisions at lunch time and went on\\nfor our last lap with nine days\' provision. We went much more easily in\\nthe afternoon, and on till 7.30 P.M. The surface was a funny mixture of\\nsmooth snow and sudden patches of sastrugi, and we occasionally appear to\\nbe on a very gradual down gradient and on a slope down from the west to\\neast.\\" In the light of what happened afterwards I believe that the party\\nwas not as fit at this time as might have been expected ten days before,\\nand that this was partly the reason why they felt the cold and found the\\npulling so hard. The immediate test was the bad surface, and this was the\\nresult of the crystals which covered the ground.\\nSimpson has worked out[301] that there is an almost constant pressure\\ngradient driving the air on the plateau northwards parallel to the 146\xb0\\nE. meridian, and parallel also to the probable edge of the plateau. The\\nmean velocity for the months of this December and January was about 11\\nmiles an hour. During this plateau journey Scott logged wind force 5 and\\nover on 23 occasions, and this wind was in their faces from the Beardmore\\nto the Pole, and at their backs as they returned. A low temperature when\\nit is calm is paradise compared to a higher temperature with a wind, and\\nit is this constant pitiless wind, combined with the altitude and low\\ntemperatures, which has made travelling on the Antarctic plateau so\\ndifficult.\\nWhile the mean velocity of wind during the two midsummer months seems to\\nbe fairly constant, there is a very rapid fall of temperature in\\nJanuary. The mean actual temperature found on the plateau this year in\\nDecember was -8.6\xb0, the minimum observed being -19.3\xb0. Simpson remarks\\nthat \\"it must be accounted as one of the wonders of the Antarctic that it\\ncontains a vast area of the earth\'s surface where the mean temperature\\nduring the warmest month is more than 8\xb0 below the Fahrenheit zero, and\\nwhen throughout the month the highest temperature was only +5.5\xb0 F.\\"[302]\\nBut the mean temperature on the plateau dropped 10\xb0 in January to -18.7\xb0,\\nthe minimum observed being -29.7\xb0. These temperatures have to be combined\\nwith the wind force described above to imagine the conditions of the\\nmarch. In the light of Scott\'s previous plateau journey[303] and\\nShackleton\'s Polar Journey[304] this wind was always expected by our\\nadvance parties. But there can be no doubt that the temperature falls as\\nsolar radiation decreases more rapidly than was generally supposed. Scott\\nprobably expected neither such a rapid fall of temperature, nor the very\\nbad surfaces, though he knew that the plateau would mean a trying time,\\nand indeed it was supposed that it would be much the hardest part of the\\njourney.\\nOn the night of January 15, Scott wrote \\"it ought to be a certain thing\\nnow, and the only appalling possibility the sight of the Norwegian flag\\nforestalling ours.\\"[305] They were 27 miles from the Pole.\\nThe story of the next three days is taken from Wilson\'s diary:\\n\\"_January 16._ We got away at 8 A.M. and made 7.5 miles by 1.15, lunched,\\nand then in 5.3 miles came on a black flag and the Norwegians\' sledge,\\nski, and dog tracks running about N.E. and S.W. both ways. The flag was\\nof black bunting tied with string to a fore-and-after which had evidently\\nbeen taken off a finished-up sledge. The age of the tracks was hard to\\nguess but probably a couple of weeks--or three or more. The flag was\\nfairly well frayed at the edges. We camped here and examined the tracks\\nand discussed things. The surface was fairly good in the forenoon -23\xb0\\ntemperature, and all the afternoon we were coming downhill with again a\\nrise to the W., and a fall and a scoop to the east where the Norwegians\\ncame up, evidently by another glacier.\\"\\n[Illustration: AMUNDSEN\'S POLHEIM--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\n\\"_January 17._ We camped on the Pole itself at 6.30 P.M. this evening. In\\nthe morning we were up at 5 A.M. and got away on Amundsen\'s tracks going\\nS.S.W. for three hours, passing two small snow cairns, and then, finding\\nthe tracks too much snowed up to follow, we made our own bee-line for the\\nPole: camped for lunch at 12.30 and off again from 3 to 6.30 P.M. It blew\\nfrom force 4 to 6 all day in our teeth with temperature -22\xb0, the coldest\\nmarch I ever remember. It was difficult to keep one\'s hands from freezing\\nin double woollen and fur mitts. Oates, Evans, and Bowers all have pretty\\nsevere frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and we had to camp early for lunch\\non account of Evans\' hands. It was a very bitter day. Sun was out now and\\nagain, and observations taken at lunch, and before and after supper, and\\nat night, at 7 P.M. and at 2 A.M. by our time. The weather was not clear,\\nthe air was full of crystals driving towards us as we came south, and\\nmaking the horizon grey and thick and hazy. We could see no sign of cairn\\nor flag, and from Amundsen\'s direction of tracks this morning he has\\nprobably hit a point about 3 miles off. We hope for clear weather\\nto-morrow, but in any case are all agreed that he can claim prior right\\nto the Pole itself. He has beaten us in so far as he made a race of it.\\nWe have done what we came for all the same and as our programme was made\\nout. From his tracks we think there were only 2 men, on ski, with plenty\\nof dogs on rather low diet. They seem to have had an oval tent. We sleep\\none night at the Pole and have had a double hoosh with some last bits of\\nchocolate, and X\'s cigarettes have been much appreciated by Scott and\\nOates and Evans. A tiring day: now turning into a somewhat starchy frozen\\nbag. To-morrow we start for home and shall do our utmost to get back in\\ntime to send the news to the ship.\\"\\n\\"_January 18._ Sights were taken in the night, and at about 5 A.M. we\\nturned out and marched from this night camp about 3\xbe miles back in a\\nS.E.ly direction to a spot which we judged from last night\'s sights to be\\nthe Pole. Here we lunched camp: built a cairn: took photos: flew the\\nQueen Mother\'s Union Jack and all our own flags. We call this the Pole,\\nthough as a matter of fact we went \xbd mile farther on in a S. easterly\\ndirection after taking further sights to the actual final spot, and here\\nwe left the Union Jack flying. During the forenoon we passed the\\nNorwegians\' last southerly camp: they called it Polheim and left here a\\nsmall tent with Norwegian and Fram flags flying, and a considerable\\namount of gear in the tent: half reindeer sleeping-bags, sleeping-socks,\\nreinskin trousers 2 pair, a sextant, and artif[icial] horizon, a\\nhypsometer with all the thermoms broken, etc. I took away the spirit-lamp\\nof it, which I have wanted for sterilizing and making disinfectant\\nlotions of snow. There were also letters there: one from Amundsen to King\\nHaakon, with a request that Scott should send it to him. There was also a\\nlist of the five men who made up their party, but no news as to what they\\nhad done. I made some sketches here, but it was blowing very cold, -22\xb0.\\nBirdie took some photos. We found no sledge there though they said there\\nwas one: it may have been buried in drift. The tent was a funny little\\nthing for 2 men, pegged out with white line and tent-pegs of yellow wood.\\nI took some strips of blue-grey silk off the tent seams: it was perished.\\nThe Norskies had got to the Pole on December 16, and were here from 15th\\nto 17th. At our lunch South Pole Camp we saw a sledge-runner with a black\\nflag about \xbd mile away blowing from it. Scott sent me on ski to fetch it,\\nand I found a note tied to it showing that this was the Norskies\' actual\\nfinal Pole position. I was given the flag and the note with Amundsen\'s\\nsignature, and I got a piece of the sledge-runner as well. The small\\nchart of our wanderings shows best how all these things lie. After lunch\\nwe made 6.2 miles from the Pole Camp to the north again, and here we are\\ncamped for the night.\\"[306]","image":null},{"merge":"C18.04","output":"Summary: The passage discusses the journey of a team near the South Pole.

These were definitely S.E.ly. up to about Lat.\\n78\xb0 30\xb4 S., where the summit was passed and we started to go definitely\\ndownhill toward the Pole. An indefinite area was then crossed S.E.ly,\\nS.ly and S.W.ly sastrugi. Later, in about 79\xb0 30\xb4 S., those from the\\nS.S.W. predominated. At this point also the surface of the ice-cap became\\naffected by undulations running more or less at right angles to our\\ncourse. These resolved themselves into immense waves some miles in\\nextent,[307] with a uniform surface both in hollow and crust. The whole\\nsurface was carpeted with a deposit of ice-crystals which, while we were\\nthere, fell sometimes in the form of minute spicules and sometimes in\\nplates. These caused an almost continuous display of parhelia.\\n\\"The flags left a month previously by the Norwegian expedition were\\npractically undamaged and so could not have been exposed to very heavy\\nwind during that time. Their sledging and ski tracks, where marked, were\\nraised slightly, also the dogs\' footprints. In the neighbourhood of their\\nSouth Pole Camp the drifts were S.W.ly, but there was one S.S.E. drift to\\nleeward of tent. They had pitched their tent to allow for S.W.ly wind.\\nFor walking on foot the ground was all pretty soft, and on digging down\\nthe crystalline structure of the snow was found to alter very little, and\\nthere were no layers of crust such as are found on the Barrier. The snow\\nseems so lightly put together as not to cohere, and makes very little\\nwater for its bulk when melted. The constant and varied motion of cirrus,\\nand the forming and motion of radiant points, shows that in the upper\\natmosphere at this time of the year there is little or no\\ntranquillity.\\"[308]\\nThat is the bare bones of what was without any possible doubt a great\\nshock. Consider! These men had been out 2\xbd months and were 800 miles\\nfrom home. The glacier had been a heavy grind: the plateau certainly not\\nworse, probably better, than was expected, as far as that place where the\\nLast Return Party left them. But then, in addition to a high altitude, a\\nhead wind, and a temperature which averaged -18.7\xb0, came this shower of\\nice-crystals, turning the surface to sand, especially when the sun was\\nout. They were living in cirrus clouds, and the extraordinary state seems\\nto have obtained that the surface of the snow was colder when the sun was\\nshining than when clouds checked the radiation from it. They began to\\ndescend. Things began to go not quite right: they felt the cold,\\nespecially Oates and Evans: Evans\' hands also were wrong--ever since the\\nseamen made that new sledge. The making of that sledge must have been\\nfiercely cold work: one of the hardest jobs they did. I am not sure that\\nenough notice has been taken of that.\\nAnd then: \\"The Norwegians have forestalled us and are first at the Pole.\\nIt is a terrible disappointment, and I am very sorry for my loyal\\ncompanions. Many thoughts come and much discussion have we had. To-morrow\\nwe must march on to the Pole and then hasten home with all the speed we\\ncan compass. All the day-dreams must go; it will be a wearisome return.\\"\\n\\"The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those\\nexpected ... companions labouring on with cold feet and hands.... Evans\\nhad such cold hands we camped for lunch ... the wind is blowing hard, T.\\n-21\xb0, and there is that curious damp, cold feeling in the air which\\nchills one to the bone in no time.... Great God! this is an awful\\nplace....\\"[309]\\nThis is not a cry of despair. It is an ejaculation provoked by the\\nghastly facts. Even now in January the temperature near the South Pole is\\nabout 24\xb0 lower than it is during the corresponding month of the year\\n(July) near the North Pole,[310] and if it is like this in mid-summer,\\nwhat is it like in mid-winter? At the same time it was, with the\\nexception of the sandy surfaces, what they had looked for, and every\\ndetail of organization was working out as well as if not better than had\\nbeen expected.\\nBowers was so busy with the meteorological log and sights which were\\ntaken in terribly difficult circumstances that he kept no diary until\\nthey started back. Then he wrote on seven consecutive days, as follows:\\n\\"_January 19._ A splendid clear morning with a fine S.W. wind blowing.\\nDuring breakfast time I sewed a flap attachment on to the hood of my\\ngreen hat so as to prevent the wind from blowing down my neck on the\\nmarch. We got up the mast and sail on the sledge and headed north,\\npicking up Amundsen\'s cairn and our outgoing tracks shortly afterwards.\\nAlong these we travelled till we struck the other cairn and finally the\\nblack flag where we had made our 58th outward camp. We then with much\\nrelief left all traces of the Norwegians behind us, and headed on our own\\ntrack till lunch camp, when we had covered eight miles.\\n\\"In the afternoon we passed No. 2 cairn of the British route, and fairly\\nslithered along before a fresh breeze. It was heavy travelling for me,\\nnot being on ski, but one does not mind being tired if a good march is\\nmade. We did sixteen [miles] altogether for the day, and so should pick\\nup our Last Dep\xf4t to-morrow afternoon. The weather became fairly thick\\nsoon after noon, and at the end of the afternoon there was considerable\\ndrift, with a mist caused by ice-crystals, and parhelion.\\"\\n\\"_January 20._ Good sailing breeze again this morning. It is a great\\npleasure to have one\'s back to the wind instead of having to face it. It\\ncame on thicker later, but we sighted the Last Dep\xf4t soon after 1 P.M.\\nand reached it at 1.45 P.M. The red flag on the bamboo pole was blowing\\nout merrily to welcome us back from the Pole, with its supply of\\nnecessaries of life below. We are absolutely dependent upon our dep\xf4ts to\\nget off the plateau alive, and so welcome the lonely little cairns\\ngladly. At this one, called the Last Dep\xf4t, we picked up four days\' food,\\na can of oil, some methylated spirit (for lighting purposes) and some\\npersonal gear we had left there. The bamboo was bent on to the\\nfloor-cloth as a yard for our sail instead of a broken sledge-runner of\\nAmundsen\'s which we had found at the Pole and made a temporary yard of.\\n\\"As we had marched extra long in the forenoon in order to reach the\\ndep\xf4t, our afternoon march was shorter than usual. The wind increased to\\na moderate gale with heavy gusts and considerable drift. We should have\\nhad a bad time had we been facing it. After an hour I had to shift my\\nharness aft so as to control the motions of the sledge. Unfortunately the\\nsurface got very sandy latterly, but we finished up with 16.1 miles to\\nour credit and camped in a stiff breeze, which resolved itself into a\\nblizzard a few hours later. I was glad we had our dep\xf4t safe.\\"\\n\\"_January 21._ Wind increased to force 8 during night with heavy drift.\\nIn the morning it was blizzing like blazes and marching was out of the\\nquestion. The wind would have been of great assistance to us, but the\\ndrift was so thick that steering a course would have been next to\\nimpossible. We decided to await developments and get under weigh as soon\\nas it showed any signs of clearing. Fortunately it was shortlived, and\\ninstead of lasting the regulation two days it eased up in the afternoon,\\nand 3.45 found us off with our sail full. It was good running on ski but\\nsoft plodding for me on foot. I shall be jolly glad to pick up my dear\\nold ski. They are nearly 200 miles away yet, however. The breeze fell\\naltogether latterly and I shifted up into my old place as middle number\\nof the five. Our distance completed was 5.5 miles, when camp was made\\nagain. Our old cairns are of great assistance to us, also the tracks,\\nwhich are obliterated in places by heavy drift and hard sastrugi, but can\\nbe followed easily.\\"\\n\\"_January 22._ We came across Evans\' sheepskin boots this morning. They\\nwere almost covered up after their long spell since they fell off the\\nsledge [on January 11]. The breeze was fair from the S.S.W. but got\\nlighter and lighter. At lunch camp we had completed 8.2 miles. In the\\nafternoon the breeze fell altogether, and the surface, acted on by the\\nsun, became perfect sawdust. The light sledge pulled by five men came\\nalong like a drag without a particle of slide or give. We were all glad\\nto camp soon after 7 P.M. I think we were all pretty tired out. We did\\naltogether 19.5 miles for the day. We are only thirty miles from the 1\xbd\\nDegree Dep\xf4t, and should reach it in two marches with any luck.\\" [The\\nminimum temperature this night was -30\xb0 (uncorrected).]\\n\\"_January 23._ Started off with a bit of a breeze which helped us a\\nlittle [temperature -28\xb0]. After the first two hours it increased to\\nforce 4, S.S.W., and filling the sail we sped along merrily, doing 8\xbe\\nmiles before lunch. In the afternoon it was even stronger, and I had to\\ngo back on the sledge and act as guide and brakesman.

I have an idea that his anxiety to sketch\\nwhenever opportunity offered, and his willingness to take off his goggles\\nto search for tracks and cairns, had something to do with it. This attack\\nwas very typical. \\"I wrote this at lunch and in the evening had a bad\\nattack of snow blindness.\\" ... \\"Blizzard in afternoon. We only got in a\\nforenoon march. Couldn\'t see enough of the tracks to follow at all.

Eyes still very painful and watering.

The sun\\ncomes out on sandy drifts, all on the move in the wind, and temp. -20\xb0,\\nand gives us an absolutely awful surface with no glide at all for ski or\\nsledge, and just like fine sand. The weather all day has been more or\\nless overcast with white broken alto-stratus, and for 3 degrees above the\\nhorizon there is a grey belt looking like a blizzard of drift, but this\\nin reality is caused by a constant fall of minute snow crystals, very\\nminute. Sometimes instead of crystal plates the fall is of minute\\nagglomerate spicules like tiny sea-urchins. The plates glitter in the sun\\nas though of some size, but you can only just see them as pin-points on\\nyour burberry. So the spicule collections are only just visible. Our\\nhands are never warm enough in camp to do any neat work now. The weather\\nis always uncomfortably cold and windy, about -23\xb0, but after lunch\\nto-day I got a bit of drawing done.\\"[317]\\nAll the joy had gone from their sledging. They were hungry, they were\\ncold, the pulling was heavy, and two of them were not fit. As long ago as\\nJanuary 14 Scott wrote that Oates was feeling the cold and fatigue more\\nthan the others[318] and again he refers to the matter on January\\n20.[319] On January 19 Wilson wrote: \\"We get our hairy faces and mouths\\ndreadfully iced up on the march, and often one\'s hands very cold indeed\\nholding ski-sticks.

Then we picked up the\\nmemorable camp where I transferred to the advance party. How glad I was\\nto change over.

The whole of the Tibialis anticus is\\nswollen and tight, and full of teno synovitis, and the skin red and\\noedematous over the shin. But we made a very fine march with the help of\\na brisk breeze.\\" January 31: \\"Again walking by the sledge with swollen\\nleg but not nearly so painful. We had 5.8 miles to go to reach our Three\\nDegree Dep\xf4t. Picked this up with a week\'s provision and a line from\\nEvans, and then for lunch an extra biscuit each, making 4 for lunch and\\n1/10 whack of butter extra as well. Afternoon we passed cairn where\\nBirdie\'s ski had been left. These we picked up and came on till 7.30 P.M.\\nwhen the wind which had been very light all day dropped, and with temp.\\n-20\xb0 it felt delightfully warm and sunny and clear. We have 1/10 extra\\npemmican in the hoosh now also. My leg pretty swollen again\\nto-night.\\"[326] They travelled 13.5 miles that day, and 15.7 on the next.\\n\\"My leg much more comfortable, gave me no pain, and I was able to pull\\nall day, holding on to the sledge. Still some oedema. We came down a\\nhundred feet or so to-day on a fairly steep gradient.\\"[327]\\nThey were now approaching the crevassed surfaces and the ice-falls which\\nmark the entrance to the Beardmore Glacier, and February 2 was marked by\\nanother accident, this time to Scott. \\"On a very slippery surface I came\\nan awful \'purler\' on my shoulder. It is horribly sore to-night and\\nanother sick person added to our tent--three out of five injured, and the\\nmost troublesome surfaces to come. We shall be lucky if we get through\\nwithout serious injury. Wilson\'s leg is better, but might easily get bad\\nagain, and Evans\' fingers.... We have managed to get off 17 miles. The\\nextra food is certainly helping us, but we are getting pretty hungry. The\\nweather is already a trifle warmer, the altitude lower and only 80 miles\\nor so to Mount Darwin. It is time we were off the summit.--Pray God\\nanother four days will see us pretty well clear of it. Our bags are\\ngetting very wet and we ought to have more sleep.\\"[328]\\nThey had been spending some time in finding the old tracks. But they had\\na good landfall for the dep\xf4t at the top of the glacier and on February 3\\nthey decided to push on due north, and to worry no more for the present\\nabout tracks and cairns. They did 16 miles that day. Wilson\'s diary runs:\\n\\"Sunny and breezy again. Came down a series of slopes, and finished the\\nday by going up one. Enormous deep-cut sastrugi and drifts and shiny\\negg-shell surface. Wind all S.S.E.ly. To-day at about 11 P.M. we got our\\nfirst sight again of mountain peaks on our eastern horizon.... We crossed\\nthe outmost line of crevassed ridge top to-day, the first on our return.\\n[Illustration: BUCKLEY ISLAND--Where The Fossils Were Found.]\\n\\"_February 4._ 18 miles. Clear cloudless blue sky, surface drift. During\\nforenoon we came down gradual descent including 2 or 3 irregular terrace\\nslopes, on crest of one of which were a good many crevasses. Southernmost\\nwere just big enough for Scott and Evans to fall in to their waists, and\\nvery deceptively covered up. They ran east and west. Those nearer the\\ncrest were the ordinary broad street-like crevasses, well lidded. In the\\nafternoon we again came to a crest, before descending, with street\\ncrevasses, and one we crossed had a huge hole where the lid had fallen\\nin, big enough for a horse and cart to go down. We have a great number of\\nmountain tops on our right and south of our beam as we go due north now.\\nWe are now camped just below a great crevassed mound, on a mountain top\\nevidently.\\"\\n\\"_February 5._ 18.2 miles. We had a difficult day, getting in amongst a\\nfrightful chaos of broad chasm-like crevasses. We kept too far east and\\nhad to wind in and out amongst them and cross multitudes of bridges.\\nWe then bore west a bit and got on better all the afternoon and got round\\na good deal of the upper disturbances of the falls here.\\"\\n[Scott wrote: \\"We are camped in a very disturbed region, but the wind has\\nfallen very light here, and our camp is comfortable for the first time\\nfor many weeks.\\"[329]]\\n\\"_February 6._ 15 miles. We again had a forenoon of trying to cut\\ncorners. Got in amongst great chasms running E. and W. and had to come\\nout again. We then again kept west and downhill over tremendous sastrugi,\\nwith a slight breeze, very cold. In afternoon continued bearing more and\\nmore towards Mount Darwin: we got round one of the main lines of ice-fall\\nand looked back up to it.... Very cold march: many crevasses: I walking\\nby the sledge on foot found a good many: the others all on ski.\\"\\n\\"_February 7._ 15.5 miles. Clear day again and we made a tedious march in\\nthe forenoon along a flat or two, and down a long slope: and then in the\\nafternoon we had a very fresh breeze, and very fast run down long slopes\\ncovered with big sastrugi. It was a strenuous job steering and checking\\nbehind by the sledge. We reached the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t by 7.30 P.M. and\\nfound everything right.\\"[330]\\nThis was the end of the plateau: the beginning of the glacier. Their hard\\ntime should be over so far as the weather was concerned. Wilson notes how\\nfine the land looked as they approached it: \\"The colour of the Dominion\\nRange rock is in the main all brown madder or dark reddish chocolate, but\\nthere are numerous bands of yellow rock scattered amongst it.

We are by no means worn out.\\"[334]\\nThere are no germs in the Antarctic, save for a few isolated specimens\\nwhich almost certainly come down from civilization in the upper air\\ncurrents. You can sleep all night in a wet bag and clothing, and sledge\\nall day in a mail of ice, and you will not catch a cold nor get any\\naches. You can get deficiency diseases, like scurvy, for inland this is a\\ndeficiency country, without vitamines. You can also get poisoned if you\\nallow your food to remain thawed out too long, and if you do not cover\\nthe provisions in a dep\xf4t with enough snow the sun will get at them, even\\nthough the air temperature is far below freezing. But it is not easy to\\nbecome diseased.\\nOn the other hand, once something does go wrong it is the deuce and all\\nto get it right: especially cuts. And the isolation of the polar\\ntraveller may place him in most difficult circumstances. There are no\\nambulances and hospitals, and a man on a sledge is a very serious weight.\\nPractically any man who undertakes big polar journeys must face the\\npossibility of having to commit suicide to save his companions, and the\\ndifficulty of this must not be overrated, for it is in some ways more\\ndesirable to die than to live if things are bad enough: we got to that\\nstage on the Winter Journey. I remember discussing this question with\\nBowers, who had a scheme of doing himself in with a pick-axe if necessity\\narose, though how he could have accomplished it I don\'t know: or, as he\\nsaid, there might be a crevasse and at any rate there was the medical\\ncase. I was horrified at the time: I had never faced the thing out with\\nmyself like that.\\nThey left the Upper Glacier Dep\xf4t under Mount Darwin on February 8. This\\nday they collected the most important of those geological specimens to\\nwhich, at Wilson\'s special request, they clung to the end, and which were\\nmostly collected by him. Mount Darwin and Buckley Island, which are\\nreally the tops of high mountains, stick out of the ice at the top of the\\nglacier, and the course ran near to both of them, but not actually up\\nagainst them. Shackleton found coal on Buckley Island, and it was clear\\nthat the place was of great geological importance, for it was one of the\\nonly places in the Antarctic where fossils could be found, so far as we\\nknew. The ice-falls stretched away as far as you could see towards the\\nmountains which bound the glacier on either side, and as you looked\\nupwards towards Buckley Island they were like a long breaking wave. One\\nof the great difficulties about the Beardmore was that you saw the\\nice-falls as you went up, and avoided them, but coming down you knew\\nnothing of their whereabouts until you fell into the middle of pressure\\nand crevasses, and then it was almost impossible to say whether you\\nshould go right or left to get out.\\nEvans was unable to pull this day, and was detached from the sledge, but\\nthis was not necessarily a very serious sign: Shackleton on his return\\njourney was not able to pull at this place. Wilson wrote as follows:\\n\\"_February 8, Mt. Buckley Cliffs._ A very busy day. We had a very cold\\nforenoon march, blowing like blazes from the S. Birdie detached and went\\non ski to Mt. Darwin and collected some dolerite, the only rock he could\\nsee on the Nunatak, which was nearest. We got into a sort of crusted\\nsurface where the snow broke through nearly to our knees and the\\nsledge-runner also. I thought at first we were all on a thinly bridged\\ncrevasse. We then came on east a bit, and gradually got worse and worse\\ngoing over an ice-fall, having great trouble to prevent sledge taking\\ncharge, but eventually got down and then made N.W. or N. into the land,\\nand camped right by the moraine under the great sandstone cliffs of Mt.\\nBuckley, out of the wind and quite warm again: it was a wonderful change.\\nAfter lunch we all geologized on till supper, and I was very late turning\\nin, examining the moraine after supper. Socks, all strewn over the rocks,\\ndried splendidly. Magnificent Beacon sandstone cliffs. Masses of\\nlimestone in the moraine, and dolerite crags in various places. Coal\\nseams at all heights in the sandstone cliffs, and lumps of weathered coal\\nwith fossil vegetable. Had a regular field-day and got some splendid\\nthings in the short time.\\"\\n\\"_February 9, Moraine visit._ We made our way along down the moraine, and\\nat the end of Mt. Buckley [I] unhitched and had half an hour over the\\nrocks and again got some good things written up in sketch-book. We then\\nleft the moraine and made a very good march on rough blue ice all day\\nwith very small and scarce scraps of n\xe9v\xe9, on one of which we camped for\\nthe night with a rather overcast foggy sky, which cleared to bright sun\\nin the night. We are all thoroughly enjoying temps. of +10\xb0 or\\nthereabouts now, with no wind instead of the summit winds which are\\nincessant with temp. -20\xb0.\\"\\n\\"_February 10._ ?16 m. We made a very good forenoon march from 10 to 2.45\\ntowards the Cloudmaker. Weather overcast gradually obscured everything in\\nsnowfall fog, starting with crystals of large size.... We had to camp\\nafter 2\xbd hours\' afternoon march as it got too thick to see anything and\\nwe were going downhill on blue ice....\\"[335]\\n[Illustration: BUCKLEY ISLAND--E. A. Wilson, del. Emery Walker Limited,\\nCollotypers.]\\nThe next day in bad lights and on a bad surface they fell into the same\\npressure which both the other returning parties experienced. Like them\\nthey were in the middle of it before they realized. \\"Then came the fatal\\ndecision to steer east. We went on for 6 hours, hoping to do a good\\ndistance, which I suppose we did, but for the last hour or two we\\npressed on into a regular trap. Getting on to a good surface we did not\\nreduce our lunch meal, and thought all going well, but half an hour after\\nlunch we got into the worst ice mess I have ever been in. For three hours\\nwe plunged on on ski, first thinking we were too much to the right, then\\ntoo much to the left; meanwhile the disturbance got worse and my spirits\\nreceived a very rude shock. There were times when it seemed almost\\nimpossible to find a way out of the awful turmoil in which we found\\nourselves.... The turmoil changed in character, irregular crevassed\\nsurface giving way to huge chasms, closely packed and most difficult to\\ncross. It was very heavy work, but we had grown desperate. We won through\\nat 10 P.M., and I write after 12 hours on the march....\\"[336]\\nWilson continues the story:\\n\\"_February 12._ We had a good night just outside the ice-falls and\\ndisturbances, and a small breakfast of tea, thin hoosh and biscuit, and\\nbegan the forenoon by a decent bit of travelling on rubbly blue ice in\\ncrampons: then plunged into an ice-fall and wandered about in it for\\nhours and hours.\\"\\n\\"_February 13._ We had one biscuit and some tea after a night\'s sleep on\\nvery hard and irregular blue ice amongst the ice-fall crevasses. No snow\\non the tent, only ski, etc. Got away at 10 A.M. and by 2 P.M. found the\\ndep\xf4t, having had a good march over very hard rough blue ice. Only \xbd hour\\nin the disturbance of yesterday. The weather was very thick, snowing and\\novercast, could only just see the points of bearing for dep\xf4t. However,\\nwe got there, tired and hungry, and camped and had hoosh and tea and 3\\nbiscuits each. Then away again with our three and a half days\' food from\\nthis red flag dep\xf4t and off down by the Cloudmaker moraine. We travelled\\nabout 4 hours on hard blue ice, and I was allowed to geologize the last\\nhour down the two outer lines of boulders. The outer one all dolerite and\\nquartz rocks, the inner all dolerite and sandstone....

Wilson, del.]\\nWilson\'s diary continues: \\"_February 15. 13\xbe m. geog._ I got on ski again\\nfirst time since damaging my leg and was on them all day for 9 hours. It\\nwas a bit painful and swelled by the evening, and every night I put on\\nsnow poultice. We are not yet abreast of Mt. Kyffin, and much discussion\\nhow far we are from the Lower Glacier Dep\xf4t, probably 18 to 20 m.: and we\\nhave to reduce food again, only one biscuit to-night with a thin hoosh of\\npemmican. To-morrow we have to make one day\'s food which remains last\\nover the two. The weather became heavily overcast during the afternoon\\nand then began to snow, and though we got in our 4 hours\' march it was\\nwith difficulty, and we only made a bit over 5 miles. However, we are\\nnearer the dep\xf4t to-night.\\"\\n\\"_February 16. 12\xbd m. geog._ Got a good start in fair weather after one\\nbiscuit and a thin breakfast, and made 7\xbd m. in the forenoon. Again the\\nweather became overcast and we lunched almost at our old bearing on\\nKyffin of lunch Dec. 15. All the afternoon the weather became thick and\\nthicker and after 3\xbc hours Evans collapsed, sick and giddy, and unable to\\nwalk even by the sledge on ski, so we camped. Can see no land at all\\nanywhere, but we must be getting pretty near the Pillar Rock. Evans\'\\ncollapse has much to do with the fact that he has never been sick in his\\nlife and is now helpless with his hands frost-bitten. We had thin meals\\nfor lunch and supper.\\"\\n\\"_February 17._ The weather cleared and we got away for a clear run to\\nthe dep\xf4t and had gone a good part of the way when Evans found his ski\\nshoes coming off. He was allowed to readjust and continue to pull, but it\\nhappened again, and then again, so he was told to unhitch, get them\\nright, and follow on and catch us up. He lagged far behind till lunch,\\nand when we camped we had lunch, and then went back for him as he had not\\ncome up. He had fallen and had his hands frost-bitten, and we then\\nreturned for the sledge, and brought it, and fetched him in on it as he\\nwas rapidly losing the use of his legs. He was comatose when we got him\\ninto the tent, and he died without recovering consciousness that night\\nabout 10 P.M. We had a short rest for an hour or two in our bags that\\nnight, then had a meal and came on through the pressure ridges about 4\\nmiles farther down and reached our Lower Glacier Dep\xf4t. Here we camped at\\nlast, had a good meal and slept a good night\'s rest which we badly\\nneeded. Our dep\xf4t was all right.\\"[339] \\"A very terrible day.... On\\ndiscussing the symptoms we think he began to get weaker just before we\\nreached the Pole, and that his downward path was accelerated first by\\nthe shock of his frost-bitten fingers, and later by falls during rough\\ntravelling on the glacier, further by his loss of all confidence in\\nhimself.

FARTHEST SOUTH\\n\\nStevenson has written of a traveller whose wife slumbered by his side\\nwhat time his spirit re-adventured forth in memory of days gone by. He\\nwas quite happy about it, and I suppose his travels had been peaceful,\\nfor days and nights such as these men spent coming down the Beardmore\\nwill give you nightmare after nightmare, and wake you shrieking--years\\nafter.\\nOf course they were shaken and weakened. But the conditions they had\\nfaced, and the time they had been out, do not in my opinion account\\nentirely for their weakness nor for Evans\' collapse, which may have had\\nsomething to do with the fact that he was the biggest, heaviest and most\\nmuscular man in the party. I do not believe that this is a life for such\\nmen, who are expected to pull their weight and to support and drive a\\nlarger machine than their companions, and at the same time to eat no\\nextra food. If, as seems likely, the ration these men were eating was not\\nenough to support the work they were doing, then it is clear that the\\nheaviest man will feel the deficiency sooner and more severely than\\nothers who are smaller than he. Evans must have had a most terrible time:\\nI think it is clear from the diaries that he had suffered very greatly\\nwithout complaint. At home he would have been nursed in bed: here he must\\nmarch (he was pulling the day he died) until he was crawling on his\\nfrost-bitten hands and knees in the snow--horrible: most horrible perhaps\\nfor those who found him so, and sat in the tent and watched him die. I am\\ntold that simple concussion does not kill as suddenly as this: probably\\nsome clot had moved in his brain.\\nFor one reason and another they took very nearly as long to come down the\\nglacier with a featherweight sledge as we had taken to go up it with full\\nloads. Seven days\' food were allowed from the Upper to the Lower Glacier\\nDep\xf4t. Bowers told me that he thought this was running it fine. But the\\ntwo supporting parties got through all right, though they both tumbled\\ninto the horrible pressure above the Cloudmaker. The Last Return Party\\ntook 7\xbd days: the Polar Party 10 days: the latter had been 25\xbd days\\nlonger on the plateau than the former. Owing to their slow progress down\\nthe glacier the Polar Party went on short rations for the first and last\\ntime until they camped on March 19: with the exception of these days they\\nhad either their full, or more than their full ration until that date.\\nUntil they reached the Barrier on their return journey the weather can be\\ndescribed neither as abnormal nor as unexpected. There were 300 statute\\nmiles (260 geo.) to be covered to One Ton Dep\xf4t, and 150 statute miles\\n(130 geo.) more from One Ton to Hut Point. They had just picked up one\\nweek\'s food for five men: between the Beardmore and One Ton were three\\nmore dep\xf4ts each with one week\'s food for five men. They were four men:\\ntheir way was across the main body of the Barrier out of sight of land,\\nand away from any immediate influence of the comparatively warm sea ahead\\nof them. Nothing was known of the weather conditions in the middle of the\\nBarrier at this time of year, and no one suspected that March conditions\\nthere were very cold. Shackleton turned homeward on January 10: reached\\nhis Bluff Dep\xf4t on February 23, and Hut Point on February 28.\\nWilson\'s diary continues:\\n\\"_February 18._ We had only five hours\' sleep. We had butter and biscuit\\nand tea when we woke at 2 P.M., then came over the Gap entrance to the\\npony-slaughter camp, visiting a rock moraine of Mt. Hope on the way.\\"\\n\\"_February 19._ Late in getting away after making up new 10-foot sledge\\nand digging out pony meat. We made 5\xbd m. on a very heavy surface\\nindeed.\\"[341]\\nThis bad surface is the feature of their first homeward marches on the\\nBarrier. From now onwards they complain always of the terrible surfaces,\\nbut a certain amount of the heavy pulling must be ascribed to their own\\nweakness. In the low temperatures which occurred later bad surfaces were\\nto be expected: but now the temperatures were not really low, about zero\\nto -17\xb0: fine clear days for the most part and, a thing to be noticed,\\nlittle wind. They wanted wind, which would probably be behind them from\\nthe south. \\"Oh! for a little wind,\\" Scott writes. \\"E. Evans evidently had\\nplenty.\\" He was already very anxious. \\"If this goes on we shall have a\\nbad time, but I sincerely trust it is only the result of this windless\\narea close to the coast and that, as we are making steadily outwards, we\\nshall shortly escape it. It is perhaps premature [Feb. 19] to be anxious\\nabout covering distance. In all other respects things are improving. We\\nhave our sleeping-bags spread on the sledge and they are drying, but,\\nabove all, we have our full measure of food again. To-night we had a sort\\nof stew fry of pemmican and horseflesh, and voted it the best hoosh we\\nhad ever had on a sledge journey. The absence of poor Evans is a help to\\nthe commissariat, but if he had been here in a fit state we might have\\ngot along faster. I wonder what is in store for us, with some little\\nalarm at the lateness of the season.\\" And on February 20, when they made\\n7 miles, \\"At present our sledge and ski leave deeply ploughed tracks\\nwhich can be seen winding for miles behind. It is distressing, but as\\nusual trials are forgotten when we camp, and good food is our lot. Pray\\nGod we get better travelling as we are not so fit as we were, and the\\nseason is advancing apace.\\" And on February 21, \\"We never won a march of\\n8\xbd miles with greater difficulty, but we can\'t go on like this.\\"[342]\\nA breeze suddenly came away from S.S.E., force 4 to 6 at 11 A.M. on\\nFebruary 22, and they hoisted the sail on the sledge they had just picked\\nup. They immediately lost the tracks they were following, and failed to\\nfind the cairns and camp remains which they should have picked up if they\\nhad been on the right course, which was difficult here owing to the thick\\nweather we had on the outward march. Bowers was sure they were too near\\nthe land and they steered out, but still failed to pick up the line on\\nwhich their dep\xf4ts and their lives depended. Scott was convinced they\\nwere outside, not inside the line. The next morning Bowers took a round\\nof angles, and they came to the conclusion, on slender evidence, that\\nthey were still too near the land. They had an unhappy march still off\\nthe tracks, \\"but just as we decided to lunch, Bowers\' wonderful sharp\\neyes detected an old double lunch cairn, the theodolite telescope\\nconfirmed it, and our spirits rose accordingly.\\"[343] Then Wilson had\\nanother \\"bad attack of snow-glare: could hardly keep a chink of eye open\\nin goggles to see the course. Fat pony hoosh.\\"[344] This day they reached\\nthe Lower Barrier Dep\xf4t.\\n[Illustration: SLEDGING IN A HIGH WIND--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\nThey were in evil case, but they would have been all right, these men, if\\nthe cold had not come down upon them, a bolt quite literally from the\\nblue of a clear sky: unexpected, unforetold and fatal. The cold itself\\nwas not so tremendous until you realize that they had been out four\\nmonths, that they had fought their way up the biggest glacier in the\\nworld in feet of soft snow, that they had spent seven weeks under plateau\\nconditions of rarefied air, big winds and low temperatures, and they had\\nwatched one of their companions die--not in a bed, in a hospital or\\nambulance, nor suddenly, but slowly, night by night and day by day, with\\nhis hands frost-bitten and his brain going, until they must have\\nwondered, each man in his heart, whether in such case a human being could\\nbe left to die, that four men might live.

Some\\nmen say the weather was abnormal: there is some evidence that it was. The\\nfact remains that the temperature dropped into the minus thirties by day\\nand the minus forties by night. The fact also remains that there was a\\ngreat lack of southerly winds, and in consequence the air near the\\nsurface was not being mixed: excessive radiation took place, and a layer\\nof cold air formed near the ground. Crystals also formed on the surface\\nof the snow and the wind was not enough to sweep them away. As the\\ntemperature dropped so the surface for the runners of the sledges became\\nworse, as I explained elsewhere.[345] They were pulling as it were\\nthrough sand.\\nIn the face of the difficulties which beset them their marches were\\nmagnificent: 11\xbd miles on February 25 and again on the following day:\\n12.2 miles on February 27, and 11\xbd miles again on February 28 and 29. If\\nthey could have kept this up they would have come through without a\\ndoubt. But I think it was about now that they suspected, and then were\\nsure, that they could not pull through. Scott\'s diary, written at lunch,\\nMarch 2, is as follows:\\n\\"Misfortunes rarely come singly. We marched to the [Middle Barrier] dep\xf4t\\nfairly easily yesterday afternoon, and since that have suffered three\\ndistinct blows which have placed us in a bad position. First, we found a\\nshortage of oil; with most rigid economy it can scarce carry us to the\\nnext dep\xf4t on this surface [71 miles away]. Second, Titus Oates disclosed\\nhis feet, the toes showing very bad indeed, evidently bitten by the late\\ntemperatures. The third blow came in the night, when the wind, which we\\nhad hailed with some joy, brought dark overcast weather. It fell below\\n-40\xb0 in the night, and this morning it took 1\xbd hours to get our foot-gear\\non, but we got away before eight. We lost cairn and tracks together and\\nmade as steady as we could N. by W., but have seen nothing. Worse was to\\ncome--the surface is simply awful. In spite of strong wind and full sail\\nwe have only done 5\xbd miles. We are in a _very_ queer street, since there\\nis no doubt we cannot do the extra marches and feel the cold\\nhorribly.\\"[346]\\nThey did nearly ten miles that day, but on March 3 they had a terrible\\ntime. \\"God help us,\\" wrote Scott, \\"we can\'t keep up this pulling, that is\\ncertain. Amongst ourselves we are unendingly cheerful, but what each man\\nfeels in his heart I can only guess. Putting on foot-gear in the morning\\nis getting slower and slower, therefore every day more dangerous.\\"\\nThe following extracts are taken from Scott\'s diary.\\n\\"_March 4. Lunch._ We are in a very tight place indeed, but none of us\\ndespondent _yet_, or at least we preserve every semblance of good cheer,\\nbut one\'s heart sinks as the sledge stops dead at some sastrugi behind\\nwhich the surface sand lies thickly heaped. For the moment the\\ntemperature is in the -20\xb0--an improvement which makes us much more\\ncomfortable, but a colder snap is bound to come again soon. I fear that\\nOates at least will weather such an event very poorly. Providence to our\\naid! We can expect little from man now except the possibility of extra\\nfood at the next dep\xf4t. It will be real bad if we get there and find the\\nsame shortage of oil. Shall we get there? Such a short distance it would\\nhave appeared to us on the summit! I don\'t know what I should do if\\nWilson and Bowers weren\'t so determinedly cheerful over things.\\"\\n[Illustration: MOUNT LONGSTAFF--E. A. Wilson, del. Emery Walker Limited,\\nCollotypers.]\\n\\"_Monday, March 5. Lunch._ Regret to say going from bad to worse. We got\\na slant of wind yesterday afternoon, and going on 5 hours we converted\\nour wretched morning run of 3\xbd miles into something over 9. We went to\\nbed on a cup of cocoa and pemmican solid with the chill off.... The\\nresult is telling on all, but mainly on Oates, whose feet are in a\\nwretched condition. One swelled up tremendously last night and he is very\\nlame this morning. We started march on tea and pemmican as last night--we\\npretend to prefer the pemmican this way. Marched for 5 hours this\\nmorning over a slightly better surface covered with high moundy sastrugi.\\nSledge capsized twice; we pulled on foot, covering about 5\xbd miles. We are\\ntwo pony marches and 4 miles about from our dep\xf4t. Our fuel dreadfully\\nlow and the poor Soldier nearly done. It is pathetic enough because we\\ncan do nothing for him; more hot food might do a little, but only a\\nlittle, I fear. We none of us expected these terribly low temperatures,\\nand of the rest of us, Wilson is feeling them most; mainly, I fear, from\\nhis self-sacrificing devotion in doctoring Oates\' feet. We cannot help\\neach other, each has enough to do to take care of himself. We get cold on\\nthe march when the trudging is heavy, and the wind pierces our worn\\ngarments. The others, all of them, are unendingly cheerful when in the\\ntent. We mean to see the game through with a proper spirit, but it\'s\\ntough work to be pulling harder than we ever pulled in our lives for long\\nhours, and to feel that the progress is so slow. One can only say \'God\\nhelp us!\' and plod on our weary way, cold and very miserable, though\\noutwardly cheerful. We talk of all sorts of subjects in the tent, not\\nmuch of food now, since we decided to take the risk of running a full\\nration. We simply couldn\'t go hungry at this time.\\"\\n\\"_Tuesday, March 6. Lunch._ We did a little better with help of wind\\nyesterday afternoon, finishing 9\xbd miles for the day, and 27 miles from\\ndep\xf4t. But this morning things have been awful. It was warm in the night\\nand for the first time during the journey I overslept myself by more than\\nan hour; then we were slow with foot-gear; then, pulling with all our\\nmight (for our lives) we could scarcely advance at rate of a mile an\\nhour; then it grew thick and three times we had to get out of harness to\\nsearch for tracks. The result is something less than 3\xbd miles for the\\nforenoon. The sun is shining now and the wind gone. Poor Oates is unable\\nto pull, sits on the sledge when we are track-searching--he is\\nwonderfully plucky, as his feet must be giving him great pain. He makes\\nno complaint, but his spirits only come up in spurts now, and he grows\\nmore silent in the tent. We are making a spirit lamp to try and replace\\nthe primus when our oil is exhausted...\\"\\n\\"_Wednesday, March 7._ A little worse, I fear. One of Oates\' feet _very_\\nbad this morning; he is wonderfully brave. We still talk of what we will\\ndo together at home.\\n\\"We only made 6\xbd miles yesterday. This morning in 4\xbd hours we did just\\nover 4 miles. We are 16 from our dep\xf4t. If we only find the correct\\nproportion of food there and this surface continues, we may get to the\\nnext dep\xf4t [Mt. Hooper, 72 miles farther] but not to One Ton Camp. We\\nhope against hope that the dogs have been to Mt. Hooper; then we might\\npull through. If there is a shortage of oil again we can have little\\nhope. One feels that for poor Oates the crisis is near, but none of us\\nare improving, though we are wonderfully fit considering the really\\nexcessive work we are doing. We are only kept going by good food. No wind\\nthis morning till a chill northerly air came ahead. Sun bright and cairns\\nshowing up well. I should like to keep the track to the end.\\"\\n\\"_Thursday, March 8. Lunch._ Worse and worse in morning; poor Oates\' left\\nfoot can never last out, and time over foot-gear something awful. Have to\\nwait in night foot-gear for nearly an hour before I start changing, and\\nthen am generally first to be ready. Wilson\'s feet giving trouble now,\\nbut this mainly because he gives so much help to others. We did 4\xbd miles\\nthis morning and are now 8\xbd miles from the dep\xf4t--a ridiculously small\\ndistance to feel in difficulties, yet on this surface we know we cannot\\nequal half our old marches, and that for that effort we expend nearly\\ndouble the energy. The great question is: What shall we find at the\\ndep\xf4t? If the dogs have visited it we may get along a good distance, but\\nif there is another short allowance of fuel, God help us indeed. We are\\nin a very bad way, I fear, in any case.\\"\\n\\"_Saturday, March 10._ Things steadily downhill. Oates\' foot worse. He\\nhas rare pluck and must know that he can never get through. He asked\\nWilson if he had a chance this morning, and of course Bill had to say he\\ndidn\'t know. In point of fact he has none. Apart from him, if he went\\nunder now, I doubt whether we could get through. With great care we might\\nhave a dog\'s chance, but no more. The weather conditions are awful, and\\nour gear gets steadily more icy and difficult to manage....","image":null},{"merge":"C19.03","output":"The passage describes a group of explorers struggling to survive in the cold and harsh conditions of the south pole.

Must fight it out\\nto the last biscuit, but can\'t reduce rations.\\"\\n[Illustration: A BLIZZARD CAMP--E. A. Wilson, del.]\\n\\"_Friday, March 16, or Saturday, 17._ Lost track of dates, but think the\\nlast correct. Tragedy all along the line. At lunch, the day before\\nyesterday, poor Titus Oates said he couldn\'t go on; he proposed we should\\nleave him in his sleeping-bag. That we could not do, and we induced him\\nto come on, on the afternoon march. In spite of its awful nature for him\\nhe struggled on and we made a few miles. At night he was worse and we\\nknew the end had come.\\n\\"Should this be found I want these facts recorded. Oates\' last thoughts\\nwere of his mother, but immediately before he took pride in thinking that\\nhis regiment would be pleased with the bold way in which he met his\\ndeath. We can testify to his bravery. He has borne intense suffering for\\nweeks without complaint, and to the very last was able and willing to\\ndiscuss outside subjects. He did not--would not--give up hope till the\\nvery end. He was a brave soul. This was the end. He slept through the\\nnight before last, hoping not to wake; but he woke in the\\nmorning--yesterday. It was blowing a blizzard. He said, \'I am just going\\noutside and may be some time.\' He went out into the blizzard and we have\\nnot seen him since.\\n\\"I take this opportunity of saying that we have stuck to our sick\\ncompanions to the last. In case of Edgar Evans, when absolutely out of\\nfood and he lay insensible, the safety of the remainder seemed to demand\\nhis abandonment, but Providence mercifully removed him at this critical\\nmoment. He died a natural death, and we did not leave him till two hours\\nafter his death. We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death, but\\nthough we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the act of a brave man\\nand an English gentleman. We all hope to meet the end with a similar\\nspirit, and assuredly the end is not far.\\n\\"I can only write at lunch and then only occasionally. The cold is\\nintense, -40\xb0 at mid-day. My companions are unendingly cheerful, but we\\nare all on the verge of serious frost-bites, and though we constantly\\ntalk of fetching through I don\'t think any one of us believes it in his\\nheart.\\n\\"We are cold on the march now, and at all times except meals. Yesterday\\nwe had to lay up for a blizzard and to-day we move dreadfully slowly. We\\nare at No. 14 Pony Camp, only two pony marches from One Ton Dep\xf4t. We\\nleave here our theodolite, a camera, and Oates\' sleeping-bags. Diaries,\\netc., and geological specimens carried at Wilson\'s special request, will\\nbe found with us or on our sledge.\\"\\n\\"_Sunday, March 18._ To-day, lunch, we are 21 miles from the dep\xf4t. Ill\\nfortune presses, but better may come. We have had more wind and drift\\nfrom ahead yesterday; had to stop marching; wind N.W., force 4, temp.\\n-35\xb0. No human being could face it, and we are worn out _nearly_.\\n\\"My right foot has gone, nearly all the toes--two days ago I was proud\\npossessor of best feet.... Bowers takes first place in condition, but\\nthere is not much to choose after all. The others are still confident of\\ngetting through--or pretend to be--I don\'t know! We have the last _half_\\nfill of oil in our primus and a very small quantity of spirit--this alone\\nbetween us and thirst. The wind is fair for the moment, and that is\\nperhaps a fact to help. The mileage would have seemed ridiculously small\\non our outward journey.\\"\\n\\"_Monday, March 19. Lunch._ We camped with difficulty last night and were\\ndreadfully cold till after our supper of cold pemmican and biscuit and a\\nhalf pannikin of cocoa cooked over the spirit. Then, contrary to\\nexpectation, we got warm and all slept well. To-day we started in the\\nusual dragging manner. Sledge dreadfully heavy. We are 15\xbd miles from the\\ndep\xf4t and ought to get there in three days. What progress! We have two\\ndays\' food but barely a day\'s fuel. All our feet are getting\\nbad--Wilson\'s best, my right foot worse, left all right. There is no\\nchance to nurse one\'s feet till we can get hot food into us.

The loss of pony transport in March 1911 obliged me to start later\\nthan I had intended, and obliged the limits of stuff transported to be\\nnarrowed.\\n2. The weather throughout the outward journey, and especially the long\\ngale in 83\xb0 S., stopped us.\\n3. The soft snow in lower reaches of glacier again reduced pace.\\nWe fought these untoward events with a will and conquered, but it cut\\ninto our provision reserve.\\nEvery detail of our food supplies, clothing and dep\xf4ts made on the\\ninterior ice-sheet and over that long stretch of 700 miles to the Pole\\nand back, worked out to perfection. The advance party would have returned\\nto the glacier in fine form and with surplus of food, but for the\\nastonishing failure of the man whom we had least expected to fail. Edgar\\nEvans was thought the strongest man of the party.\\nThe Beardmore Glacier is not difficult in fine weather, but on our return\\nwe did not get a single completely fine day; this with a sick companion\\nenormously increased our anxieties.\\nAs I have said elsewhere, we got into frightfully rough ice and Edgar\\nEvans received a concussion of the brain--he died a natural death, but\\nleft us a shaken party with the season unduly advanced.\\nBut all the facts above enumerated were as nothing to the surprise which\\nawaited us on the Barrier. I maintain that our arrangements for returning\\nwere quite adequate, and that no one in the world would have expected the\\ntemperatures and surfaces which we encountered at this time of the year.\\nOn the summit in lat. 85\xb0-86\xb0 we had -20\xb0, -30\xb0. On the Barrier in lat.\\n82\xb0, 10,000 feet lower, we had -30\xb0 in the day, -47\xb0 at night pretty\\nregularly, with continuous head-wind during our day marches. It is clear\\nthat these circumstances come on very suddenly, and our wreck is\\ncertainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather, which does not\\nseem to have any satisfactory cause. I do not think human beings ever\\ncame through such a month as we have come through, and we should have got\\nthrough in spite of the weather but for the sickening of a second\\ncompanion, Captain Oates, and a shortage of fuel in our dep\xf4ts for which\\nI cannot account, and finally, but for the storm which has fallen on us\\nwithin 11 miles of the dep\xf4t at which we hoped to secure our final\\nsupplies. Surely misfortune could scarcely have exceeded this last blow.\\nWe arrived within 11 miles of our old One Ton Camp with fuel for one last\\nmeal and food for two days. For four days we have been unable to leave\\nthe tent--the gale howling about us. We are weak, writing is difficult,\\nbut for my own sake I do not regret this journey, which has shown that\\nEnglishmen can endure hardships, help one another, and meet death with as\\ngreat a fortitude as ever in the past. We took risks, we knew we took\\nthem; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for\\ncomplaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our\\nbest to the last. But if we have been willing to give our lives to this\\nenterprise, which is for the honour of our country, I appeal to our\\ncountrymen to see that those who depend on us are properly cared for.\\nHad we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood,\\nendurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the\\nheart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must\\ntell the tale, but surely, surely a great rich country like ours will see\\nthat those who are dependent on us are properly provided for.--R.\\nSCOTT.[348]\\n[Illustration: THE POLAR JOURNEY--Apsley Cherry-Garrard, del.

O my onely light,\\n            It cannot be\\n            That I am he\\n    On whom thy tempests fell all night.\\n                                         HERBERT.\\n\\nI shall inevitably be asked for a word of mature judgment of the\\nexpedition of a kind that was impossible when we were all close up to it,\\nand when I was a subaltern of 24, not incapable of judging my elders, but\\ntoo young to have found out whether my judgment was worth anything. I now\\nsee very plainly that though we achieved a first-rate tragedy, which will\\nnever be forgotten just because it was a tragedy, tragedy was not our\\nbusiness. In the broad perspective opened up by ten years\' distance, I\\nsee not one journey to the Pole, but two, in startling contrast one to\\nanother. On the one hand, Amundsen going straight there, getting there\\nfirst, and returning without the loss of a single man, and without having\\nput any greater strain on himself and his men than was all in the day\'s\\nwork of polar exploration. Nothing more business-like could be imagined.\\nOn the other hand, our expedition, running appalling risks, performing\\nprodigies of superhuman endurance, achieving immortal renown,\\ncommemorated in august cathedral sermons and by public statues, yet\\nreaching the Pole only to find our terrible journey superfluous, and\\nleaving our best men dead on the ice. To ignore such a contrast would be\\nridiculous: to write a book without accounting for it a waste of time.\\nFirst let me do full justice to Amundsen. I have not attempted to\\ndisguise how we felt towards him when, after leading us to believe that\\nhe had equipped the Fram for an Arctic journey, and sailed for the north,\\nhe suddenly made his dash for the south. Nothing makes a more unpleasant\\nimpression than a feint. But when Scott reached the Pole only to find\\nthat Amundsen had been there a month before him, his distress was not\\nthat of a schoolboy who has lost a race. I have described what it had\\ncost Scott and his four companions to get to the Pole, and what they had\\nstill to suffer in returning until death stopped them. Much of that risk\\nand racking toil had been undertaken that men might learn what the world\\nis like at the spot where the sun does not decline in the heavens, where\\na man loses his orbit and turns like a joint on a spit, and where his\\nface, however he turns, is always to the North. The moment Scott saw the\\nNorwegian tent he knew that he had nothing to tell that was not already\\nknown. His achievement was a mere precaution against Amundsen perishing\\non his way back; and that risk was no greater than his own. The Polar\\nJourney was literally laid waste: that was the shock that staggered them.\\nWell might Bowers be glad to see the last of Norskies\' tracks as their\\nhomeward paths diverged.\\nAll this heartsickness has passed away now; and the future explorer will\\nnot concern himself with it. He will ask, what was the secret of\\nAmundsen\'s slick success? What is the moral of our troubles and losses? I\\nwill take Amundsen\'s success first. Undoubtedly the very remarkable\\nqualities of the man himself had a good deal to do with it. There is a\\nsort of sagacity that constitutes the specific genius of the explorer;\\nand Amundsen proved his possession of this by his guess that there was\\nterra firma in the Bay of Whales as solid as on Ross Island. Then there\\nis the quality of big leadership which is shown by daring to take a big\\nchance. Amundsen took a very big one indeed when he turned from the route\\nto the Pole explored and ascertained by Scott and Shackleton and\\ndetermined to find a second pass over the mountains from the Barrier to\\nthe plateau. As it happened, he succeeded, and established his route as\\nthe best way to the Pole until a better is discovered. But he might\\neasily have failed and perished in the attempt; and the combination of\\nreasoning and daring that nerved him to make it can hardly be overrated.\\nAll these things helped him. Yet any rather conservative whaling captain\\nmight have refused to make Scott\'s experiment with motor transport,\\nponies and man-hauling, and stuck to the dogs; and to the use of ski in\\nrunning those dogs; and it was this quite commonplace choice that sent\\nAmundsen so gaily to the Pole and back: with no abnormal strain on men or\\ndogs, and no great hardship either. He never pulled a mile from start to\\nfinish.\\nThe very ease of the exploit makes it impossible to infer from it that\\nAmundsen\'s expedition was more highly endowed in personal qualities than\\nours. We did not suffer from too little brains or daring: we may have\\nsuffered from too much. We were primarily a great scientific expedition,\\nwith the Pole as our bait for public support, though it was not more\\nimportant than any other acre of the plateau. We followed in the steps of\\na polar expedition which brought back more results than any of its\\nforerunners: Scott\'s Discovery voyage. We had the largest and most\\nefficient scientific staff that ever left England. We were discursive. We\\nwere full of intellectual interests and curiosities of all kinds. We took\\non the work of two or three expeditions.\\nIt is obvious that there are disadvantages in such a division of energy.\\nScott wanted to reach the Pole: a dangerous and laborious exploit, but a\\npracticable one. Wilson wanted to obtain the egg of the Emperor penguin:\\na horribly dangerous and inhumanly exhausting feat which is none the less\\nimpracticable because the three men who achieved it survived by a\\nmiracle. These two feats had to be piled one on top of the other. What\\nwith the Dep\xf4t Journey and others, in addition to these two, we were\\nsledged out by the end of our second sledging season, and our worst year\\nwas still to come. We, the survivors, went in search of the dead when\\nthere was a possibly living party waiting in the ice somewhere for us to\\nsuccour them. That turned out all right, because when we got back, we\\nfound Campbell\'s party self-extricated and waiting for us, alive and\\nwell. But suppose they also had perished, what would have been said of\\nus?\\nThe practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things\\nwere done. He says dogs should have been taken; but he does not show how\\nthey could have been got up and down the Beardmore. He is scandalized\\nbecause 30 lbs. of geological specimens were deliberately added to the\\nweight of the sledge that was dragging the life out of the men who had to\\nhaul it; but he does not realize that it is the friction surfaces of the\\nsnow on the runners which mattered and not the dead weight, which in this\\ncase was almost negligible. Nor does he know that these same specimens\\ndated a continent and may elucidate the whole history of plant life. He\\nwill admit that we were all very wonderful, very heroic, very beautiful\\nand devoted: that our exploits gave a glamour to our expedition that\\nAmundsen\'s cannot claim; but he has no patience with us, and declares\\nthat Amundsen was perfectly right in refusing to allow science to use up\\nthe forces of his men, or to interfere for a moment with his single\\nbusiness of getting to the Pole and back again. No doubt he was; but we\\nwere not out for a single business: we were out for everything we could\\nadd to the world\'s store of knowledge about the Antarctic.\\nOf course the whole business simply bristles with \\"ifs\\": If Scott had\\ntaken dogs and succeeded in getting them up the Beardmore: if we had not\\nlost those ponies on the Dep\xf4t Journey: if the dogs had not been taken so\\nfar and the One Ton Dep\xf4t had been laid: if a pony and some extra oil had\\nbeen dep\xf4ted on the Barrier: if a four-man party had been taken to the\\nPole: if I had disobeyed my instructions and gone on from One Ton,\\nkilling dogs as necessary: or even if I had just gone on a few miles and\\nleft some food and fuel under a flag upon a cairn: if they had been first\\nat the Pole: if it had been any other season but that.... But always the\\nbare fact remains that Scott could not have travelled from McMurdo Sound\\nto the Pole faster than he did except with dogs; all the king\'s horses\\nand all the king\'s men could not have done it. Why, then, says the\\npractical man, did we go to McMurdo Sound instead of to the Bay of\\nWhales? Because we gained that continuity of scientific observation which\\nis so important in this work: and because the Sound was the\\nstarting-point for continuing the exploration of the only ascertained\\nroute to the Pole, via the Beardmore Glacier.","image":null},{"merge":"C20.02","output":"{\\n  \\"summary\\": \\"The author reflects on the mistakes that were made during the expedition to the South Pole and offers advice for future expeditions, including the need for better equipment and organization.

I admit that we, scrupulously economical of our\\npemmican, were terribly prodigal of our man-power. But we had to be: the\\ndraft, whatever it may have been on the whole, was not excessive at any\\ngiven point; and anyhow we just had to use every man to take every\\nopportunity. There is so much to do, and the opportunities for doing it\\nare so rare. Generally speaking, I don\'t see how we could have done\\ndifferently, but I don\'t want to see it done again; I don\'t want it to be\\nnecessary to do it again. I want to see this country tackle the job, and\\nsend enough men to do one thing at a time. They do it in Canada: why not\\nin England too?\\nBut we wasted our man-power in one way which could have been avoided. I\\nhave described how every emergency was met by calling for volunteers, and\\nhow the volunteers were always forthcoming. Unfortunately volunteering\\nwas relied on not only for emergencies, but for a good deal of everyday\\nwork that should have been organised as routine; and the inevitable\\nresult was that the willing horses were overworked. It was a point of\\nhonour not to ca\' canny. Men were allowed to do too much, and were told\\nafterwards that they had done too much; and that is not discipline. They\\nshould not have been allowed to do too much. Until our last year we never\\ninsisted on a regular routine.\\nMoney was scarce: probably Scott could not have obtained the funds for\\nthe expedition if its objective had not been the Pole. There was no lack\\nof the things which could be bought across the counter from big business\\nhouses--all landing, sledging, and scientific equipment was\\nfirst-class--but one of the first and most important items, the ship,\\nwould have sent Columbus on strike, and nearly sent us to the bottom of\\nthe sea.\\nPeople talk of the niggardly equipment of Columbus when he sailed west\\nfrom the Canaries to try a short-cut to an inhabited continent of\\nmagnificent empires, as he thought; but his three ships were, relatively\\nto the resources of that time, much better than the one old tramp in\\nwhich we sailed for a desert of ice in which the evening and morning are\\nthe year and not the day, and in which not even polar bears and reindeers\\ncan live. Amundsen had the Fram, built for polar exploration _ad hoc_.\\nScott had the Discovery. But when one thinks of these Nimrods and Terra\\nNovas, picked up second-hand in the wooden-ship market, and faked up for\\nthe transport of ponies, dogs, motors, and all the impedimenta of a polar\\nexpedition, to say nothing of the men who have to try and do scientific\\nwork inside them, one feels disposed to clamour for a Polar Factory Act\\nmaking it a crime to ship men for the ice in vessels more fit to ply\\nbetween London Bridge and Ramsgate.\\nAnd then the begging that is necessary to obtain even this equipment.\\nShackleton hanging round the doors of rich men! Scott writing begging\\nletters for months together! Is the country not ashamed?\\nModern civilized States should make up their minds to the endowment of\\nresearch, which includes exploration; and as all States benefit alike by\\nthe scientific side of it there is plenty of scope for international\\narrangement, especially in a region where the mere grabbing of territory\\nis meaningless, and no Foreign Office can trace the frontier between King\\nEdward\'s Plateau and King Haakon\'s. The Antarctic continent is still\\nmostly unexplored; but enough is known of it to put any settlement by\\nordinary pioneer emigration, pilgrim fathers and the like, out of the\\nquestion. Ross Island is not a place for a settlement: it is a place for\\nan elaborately equipped scientific station, with a staff in residence\\nfor a year at a time. Our stay of three years was far too much: another\\nyear would have driven the best of us mad. Of the five main journeys\\nwhich fell to my lot, one, the Winter Journey, should not have been\\nundertaken at all with our equipment; and two others, the Dog Journey and\\nthe Search Journey, had better have been done by fresh men. It is no use\\nrepeating that Englishmen will respond to every call and stick it to the\\ndeath: they will (some of them); but they have to pay the price all the\\nsame; and the price in my case was an overdraft on my vital capital which\\nI shall never quite pay off, and in the case of five bigger, stronger,\\nmore seasoned men, death. The establishment of such stations and of such\\na service cannot be done by individual heroes and enthusiasts cadging for\\ncheques from rich men and grants from private scientific societies: it is\\na business, like the Nares Arctic expedition, for public organization.\\nI do not suppose that in these days of aviation the next visit to the\\nPole will be made by men on foot dragging sledges, or by men on sledges\\ndragged by dogs, mules or ponies; nor will dep\xf4ts be laid in that way.\\nThe pack will not, I hope, be broken through by any old coal-burning ship\\nthat can be picked up in the second-hand market. Specially built ships,\\nand enough of them; specially engined tractors and aeroplanes; specially\\ntrained men and plenty of them, will all be needed if the work is to be\\ndone in any sort of humane and civilized fashion; and Cabinet ministers\\nand voters alike must learn to value knowledge that is not baited by\\nsuffering and death. My own bolt is shot; I do not suppose I shall ever\\ngo south again before I go west; but if I do it will be under proper and\\nreasonable conditions. I may not come back a hero; but I shall come back\\nnone the worse; for I repeat, the Antarctic, in moderation as to length\\nof stay, and with such accommodation as is now easily within the means of\\nmodern civilized Powers, is not half as bad a place for public service as\\nthe worst military stations on the equator. I hope that by the time Scott\\ncomes home--for he is coming home: the Barrier is moving, and not a trace\\nof our funeral cairn was found by Shackleton\'s men in 1916--the\\nhardships that wasted his life will be only a horror of the past, and his\\n_via dolorosa_ a highway as practicable as Piccadilly.\\nAnd now let me come down to tin tacks. No matter how well the thing is\\ndone in future, its organizers will want to know at first all we can tell\\nthem about oil, about cold, and about food. First, as to oil.\\nScott complains of a shortage of oil at several of his last dep\xf4ts. There\\nis no doubt that this shortage was due to the perishing of the leather\\nwashers of the tins which contained the paraffin oil. All these tins had\\nbeen subjected to the warmth of the sun in summer and the autumn\\ntemperatures, which were unexpectedly cold. In his Voyage of the\\nDiscovery Scott wrote as follows of the tins in which they drew their oil\\nwhen sledging: \\"Each tin had a small cork bung, which was a decided\\nweakness; paraffin _creeps_ in the most annoying manner, and a good deal\\nof oil was wasted in this way, especially when the sledges were\\ntravelling over rough ground and were shaken or, as frequently happened,\\ncapsized. It was impossible to make these bungs quite tight, however\\nclosely they were jammed down, so that in spite of a trifling extra\\nweight a much better fitting would have been a metallic screwed bung. To\\nfind on opening a fresh tin of oil that it was only three-parts full was\\nvery distressing, and of course meant that the cooker had to be used with\\nstill greater care.\\"[349] Amundsen wrote of his paraffin: \\"We kept it in\\nthe usual cans but they proved too weak; not that we lost any paraffin,\\nbut Bjaaland had to be constantly soldering to keep them tight.\\"[350]\\nOur own tins were furnished with the metallic screwed stoppers which\\nScott recommended. There was no trouble reported[351] until we came up to\\nOne Ton Camp when on the Search Journey. Here was the dep\xf4t of food and\\noil which I had laid in the previous autumn for the Polar Party, stowed\\nin a canvas \'tank\' which was buried beneath seven feet of snow; the oil\\nwas placed on the top of the snow, in order that the red tins might prove\\nan additional mark for the dep\xf4t. When we dug out the tank the food\\ninside was almost uneatable owing to the quantity of paraffin which had\\nfound its way down through seven feet of snow during the winter and\\nspring.\\nWe then found the Polar Party and learned of the shortage of oil. After\\nour return to Cape Evans some one was digging about the camp and came\\nacross a wooden case containing eight one-gallon tins of paraffin. These\\nhad been placed there in September 1911, to be landed at Cape Crozier by\\nthe Terra Nova when she came down. The ship could not take them: they\\nwere snowed up during the winter, lost and forgotten, until dug up\\nfifteen months afterwards. Three tins were full, three empty, one a third\\nfull and one two-thirds full.\\nThere can be no doubt that the oil, which was specially volatile, tended\\nto vaporize and escape through the stoppers, and that this process was\\naccelerated by the perishing, and I suggest also the hardening and\\nshrinking, of the leather washers. Another expedition will have to be\\nvery careful on this point: they might reduce the risk by burying the\\noil.","image":null},{"merge":"C20.03","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"The passage discusses the unexpected cold encountered by Scott and his team on the Barrier, which was the cause of their disaster.

It is clear\\nthat these circumstances come on very suddenly, and our wreck is\\ncertainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather, which does not\\nseem to have any satisfactory cause.\\"[352]\\nThey came down the glacier in plus temperatures: nor was there anything\\nabnormal for more than a week after they got on to the Barrier. Then\\nthere came a big drop to a -37\xb0 minimum on the night of February 26. It\\nis significant that the sun began to dip below the southern horizon at\\nmidnight about this time. \\"There is no doubt the middle of the Barrier is\\na pretty awful locality,\\" wrote Scott.\\nSimpson, in his meteorological report, has little doubt that the\\ntemperatures met by the Polar Party were abnormal. The records \\"clearly\\nbring to light the possibility of great cold at an extremely early period\\nin the year within a comparatively few miles of an open sea where the\\ntemperatures were over 40 degrees higher.\\" \\"It is quite impossible to\\nbelieve that normally there is a difference of nearly 40 degrees in March\\nbetween McMurdo Sound and the South of the Barrier.\\" The temperatures\\nrecorded by other sledge parties in March 1912 and those recorded at Cape\\nEvans form additional evidence, in Simpson\'s opinion, that the\\ntemperatures experienced by Scott were not such as might be expected\\nduring normal autumn weather.\\nSimpson\'s explanation is based upon the observations made in McMurdo\\nSound by sending up balloons with self-recording instruments attached.\\nThese showed that very rapid radiation takes place from the snow surface\\nin winter, which cools the air in the immediate neighbourhood: a cold\\nlayer of air is thus formed near the ground, which may be many degrees\\ncolder than the air above it. It becomes, as it were, colder than it\\nought to be. This, however, can only happen during an absence of wind:\\nwhen a wind blows the cold layer is swept away, the air is mixed and the\\ntemperature rises.\\nThe absence of wind from the south noted by Scott was, in Simpson\'s\\nopinion, the cause of the low temperatures met by Scott: the temperature\\nwas reduced ten degrees below normal at Cape Evans, and perhaps twenty\\ndegrees where Scott was.[353]\\nThe third question is that of food. It is this point which is most\\nimportant to future explorers. It is a fact that the Polar Party failed\\nto make their distance because they became weak, and that they became\\nweak although they were eating their full ration or more than their full\\nration of food, save for a few days when they went short on the way down\\nthe Beardmore Glacier. The first man to weaken was the biggest and\\nheaviest man in the expedition: \\"the man whom we had least expected to\\nfail.\\"\\nThe rations were of two kinds. The Barrier (B) ration was that which was\\nused on the Barrier during the outward journey towards the Pole. The\\nSummit (S) ration was the result of our experiments on the Winter\\nJourney. I expect it is the best ration which has been used to date, and\\nconsisted of biscuits 16, pemmican 12, butter 2, cocoa 0.57, sugar 3 and\\ntea 0.86 ounces; total 34.43 ounces daily per man.\\nThe twelve men who went forward started this S ration at the foot of the\\nBeardmore, and it was this ration which was left in all dep\xf4ts to see\\nthem home. It was much more satisfying than the Barrier ration, and men\\ncould not have eaten so much when leading ponies or driving dogs in the\\nearly stages of summer Barrier sledging: but man-hauling is a different\\nbusiness altogether from leading ponies or driving dogs.\\nIt is calculated that the body requires certain proportions of fat,\\ncarbohydrates and proteins to do certain work under certain conditions:\\nbut just what the absolute quantities are is not ascertained. The work of\\nthe Polar Party was laborious: the temperatures (the most important of\\nthe conditions) varied from comparative warmth up and down the glacier to\\nan average of about -20\xb0 in the rarefied air of the plateau. The\\ntemperatures met by them on their return over the Barrier were not really\\nlow for more than a week, and then there came quite commonly minus\\nthirties during the day with a further drop to minus forties at night,\\nwhen for a time the sun was below the horizon. These temperatures, which\\nare not very terrible to men who are fresh and whose clothing is new,\\nwere ghastly to these men who had striven night and day almost\\nceaselessly for four months on, as I maintain, insufficient food. Did\\nthese temperatures kill them?\\nUndoubtedly the low temperatures caused their death, inasmuch as they\\nwould have lived had the temperatures remained high. But Evans would not\\nhave lived: he died before the low temperatures occurred. What killed\\nEvans? And why did the other men weaken as they did, though they were\\neating full rations and more? Weaken so much that in the end they starved\\nto death?\\nI have always had a doubt whether the weather conditions were sufficient\\nto cause the tragedy. These men on full rations were supposed to be\\neating food of sufficient value to enable them to do the work they were\\ndoing, under the conditions which they actually met until the end of\\nFebruary, without loss of strength. They had more than their full\\nrations, but the conditions in March were much worse than they imagined\\nto be possible: when three survivors out of the five pitched their Last\\nCamp they were in a terrible state. After the war I found that Atkinson\\nhad come to wonder much as I, but he had gone farther, for he had the\\nvalues of our rations worked out by a chemical expert according to the\\nlatest knowledge and standards. I may add that, being in command after\\nScott\'s death, he increased the ration for the next year\'s sledging, so I\\nsuppose he had already come to the conclusion that the previous ration\\nwas not sufficient. The following are some of the data for which I am\\nindebted to him: the whole subject will be investigated by him and the\\nresults published in a more detailed form.\\nAccording to the most modern standards the food requirements for\\nlaborious work at a temperature of zero Fahr. (which is a fair Barrier\\naverage temperature to take) are 7714 calories to produce 10,069\\nfoot-tons of work. The actual Barrier ration which we used would generate\\n4003 calories, equivalent to 5331 foot-tons of work. Similar requirements\\nfor laborious work at -10\xb0 Fahr. (which is a high average plateau\\ntemperature) are 8500 calories to produce 11,094 foot-tons of work. The\\nactual Summit ration would generate 4889 calories, equivalent to 6608\\nfoot-tons of work. These requirements are calculated for total absorption\\nof all food-stuffs: but in practice, by visual proof, this does not take\\nplace: this is especially noticeable in the case of fats, a quantity of\\nwhich were digested neither by men, ponies, nor dogs.\\nSeveral things go to prove that our ration was not enough. In the first\\ncase we were probably not as fit as we seemed after long sledge journeys.\\nThere is no doubt that when sledging men developed an automaticity of\\ncertain muscles at the expense of other muscles: for instance, a sledge\\ncould be hauled all day at the expense of the arms, and we had little\\npower to lift weights at the end of several months of sledging. In\\nrelation to this I would add that, when the relief ship arrived in\\nFebruary 1912, four of us were at Cape Evans, but just arrived from three\\nmonths of the Polar Journey. The land party, we four among them, were\\nturned on to sledge stores ashore. This in practice meant twenty miles\\nevery day dragging a sledge; a good deal of \'humping\' heavy cases, from\\nfive o\'clock in the morning to very late at night; with uncertain meals\\nand no rests. I can remember now how hard that work was to myself and, I\\nexpect, to those others who had been away sledging. The ship\'s party\\nsledged only every other day \\"because they were not used to it.\\" This was\\nextremely bad organization, and in view of the possibility that some of\\nthe men might be required for further sledging in the autumn, just silly.\\nAgain, there is the experience of the man-hauling parties of the Polar\\nJourney. There was, you may remember, a man-hauling party on the way to\\nthe Beardmore Glacier. They travelled with a light sledge but they lost\\nweight on the Barrier ration. It is significant that they picked up\\ncondition when they started the Summit ration, especially Lashly.\\nThe Polar Party and the two returning parties, who were on the Summit\\nration from the foot of the Beardmore until the end of their journeys,\\nweakened, in Atkinson\'s opinion, more than they should have done had\\ntheir ration been sufficient. The First Return Party covered\\napproximately 1100 statute miles. At the end of their journey their\\npulling muscles were all right, but Atkinson, who led the party,\\nconsiders that they were at least 70 per cent weaker in other muscles.\\nThey all lost a great deal of weight, though they had the best conditions\\nof the three returning parties, and the temperatures met by them averaged\\nwell over zero.","image":null},{"merge":"C20.04","output":"{\\n  \\"summary\\": \\"The Second Return Party faced harsher conditions than the first, with only three men and one being so sick that he could barely function.

A characteristic note left to greet us on our return regretted\\nthey were too late to take part in the Search Journey. If I had lived\\nthrough ten months such as those men had just endured, wild horses would\\nnot have dragged me out sledging again. But they were keen to get some\\nuseful work done in the time which remained until the ship arrived.\\nWe had the Polar records: Campbell and his men, unaided, had not only\\nsurvived their terrible winter, but had sledged down the coast after it.\\nWe ourselves, faced by a difficult alternative, had fallen on our feet.\\nWe never hoped for more than this: we seldom hoped for so much.\\nI wanted a series of Ad\xe9lie penguin embryos from the rookery at Cape\\nRoyds, but had not expected an opportunity of getting them because I was\\naway sledging during the summer months. Now the chance had come. Atkinson\\nwanted to work on parasites at the same place, and others to survey. But\\nthe real job was an ascent of Erebus, the active volcano which rose from\\nour doors to some 13,400 feet in height. A party of Shackleton\'s men\\nunder Professor David went up it in March, and managed to haul a sledge\\nup to 5800 feet, from which point they had to portage their gear. A year\\nbefore this Debenham, with the help of a telescope, selected a route by\\nwhich they could haul a sledge up to 9000 feet. There proved to be no\\ngreat difficulty about it; it was just a matter of legs and breath.\\nThey were a cheery company, part-singing in the evenings and working hard\\nall day. It was an uneventful trip, Debenham said, and very harmonious:\\nthe best trip he had down there. Both Debenham and Dickason suffered from\\nmountain sickness, however, and they were the two smokers! The clearness\\nof the air was marked. At 5000 feet they could plainly see Mount\\nMelbourne and Cape Jones, between two and three hundred miles away, and\\nseveral uncharted mountains over to the west, but they were unable to\\nplot them accurately because they could get direction rays from one point\\nonly. The Sound itself was covered by cloud most of the time, but\\nBeaufort Island and Franklin Island were clear. Unlike David\'s party,\\nthey could see no signs whatever of volcanic action on Mount Bird, which\\nis almost entirely covered with ice on which it was to be expected that\\nsome mark might be left. At 9000 feet Terror looked very imposing, but\\nMount Bird and Terra Nova were insignificant and uninteresting. The\\nvalley between the old crater and the slopes of the second crater greatly\\nimpressed them, and they found a fine little crevassed glacier in it.\\nBoth Priestley and Debenham are of opinion that it is possible to get to\\nTerror by this valley, and that there are no crevassed areas or\\nimpossible slopes on the way. All the same it would probably be more\\nsensible to go from Cape Crozier.\\nAt a point about 9000 feet up, Priestley, Gran, Abbott and Hooper started\\nto make the ascent to the active crater on December 10. They packed the\\ntent, poles, bags, inner cooker and cooking gear, with four days\'\\nprovisions, and reached the second crater at about 11,500 feet, to be\\nhung up by cloud all the next day. At these altitudes the temperature\\nvaried between -10\xb0 and -30\xb0, though at sea-level simultaneously they\\nwere round about freezing-point. By 1 A.M. on the 12th the conditions\\nwere good--clear, with a southerly wind blowing the steam away from the\\nsummit. The party got away as soon as possible and reached the lip of the\\nactive crater in a few hours. Looking down they were unable to see the\\nbottom, for it was full of steam: the sides sloped at a steep angle for\\nsome 500 feet, when they became sheer precipices: the opening appeared to\\nbe about 14,000 paces round. The top is mostly pumice, but there is also\\na lot of kenyte, much the same as at sea-level: the old crater was mostly\\nkenyte, proving that this is the oldest rock of the island: felspar\\ncrystals must be continually thrown out, for they were lying about on the\\ntop of the snow; I have one nearly 3\xbd inches long.\\nTwo men went back to the camp, for one had a frost-bitten foot. This left\\nPriestley and Gran, who tried to boil the hypsometer but failed owing to\\nthe wind, which was variable and enveloped them from time to time in\\nsteam and sulphur vapour. They left a record on a cairn and started to\\nreturn. But when they had got 500 feet down Priestley found that he had\\nleft a tin of exposed films on the top instead of the record. Gran said\\nhe would go back and change it. He had reached the top when there was a\\nloud explosion: large blocks of pumice were hurled out with a big smoke\\ncloud; probably a big bubble had burst. Gran was in the middle of it,\\nheard it gurgle before it burst, saw \\"blocks of pumiceous lava, in shape\\nlike the halves of volcanic bombs, and with bunches of long, drawn-out,\\nhair-like shreds of glass in their interior.\\"[355] This was P\xe9l\xe9\'s hair.\\nGran was a bit sick from sulphur dioxide fumes afterwards. They reached\\nCape Royds on the 16th, the very successful trip taking fifteen days.\\nMeanwhile Shackleton\'s old hut was very pleasant at this time of year: in\\nwinter it was a bit too draughty. With bright sunlight, a lop on the sea\\nwhich splashed and gurgled under the ice-foot, the beautiful mountains\\nall round us, and the penguins nesting at our door, this was better than\\nthe Beardmore Glacier, where we had expected to be at this date. What\\nthen must it have been to the six men who were just returned from the\\nvery Gate of Hell? And the food: \\"Truly Shackleton\'s men must have fed\\nlike turkey-cocks from all the delicacies here: boiled chicken, kidneys,\\nmushrooms, ginger, Garibaldi biscuits, soups of all kinds: it is a\\nsplendid change. Best of all are the fresh-buttered skua\'s eggs which we\\nmake for breakfast.

It was always Wilson\'s idea\\nthat embryology was the next job of a vertebral zoologist down south. I\\nhave already explained that the penguin is an interesting link in the\\nevolutionary chain, and the object of getting this embryo is to find out\\nwhere the penguins come in.[357] Whether or no they are more primitive\\nthan other nonflying birds, such as the apteryx, the ostrich, the rhea\\nand the moa, which last is only just extinct, is an open question. But\\nwingless birds are still hanging on to the promontories of the southern\\ncontinents, where there is less rivalry than in the highly populated\\nland areas of the north. It may be that penguins are descended from\\nancestors who lived in the northern hemisphere in a winged condition\\n(even now you may sometimes see them try to fly), and that they have been\\ndriven towards the south.\\nIf penguins are primitive, it is rational to infer that the most\\nprimitive penguin is farthest south. These are the two Antarcticists, the\\nEmperor and the Ad\xe9lie. The latter appears to be the more numerous and\\nsuccessful of the two, and for this reason we are inclined to search\\namong the Emperors as being among the most primitive penguins, if not the\\nmost primitive of birds now living: hence the Winter Journey. I was glad\\nto get, in addition, this series of Ad\xe9lie penguins\' embryos, feeling\\nsomewhat like a giant who had wandered on to the wrong planet, and who\\nwas distinctly in the way of its true inhabitants.\\nWe returned too late to see the eggs laid, and therefore it was\\nimpossible to tell how old the embryos were. My hopes rose, however, when\\nI saw some eggless nests with penguins sitting upon them, but later I\\nfound that these were used as bachelor quarters by birds whose wives were\\nsitting near. I tried taking eggs from nests and was delighted to find\\nthat new eggs appeared: these I carefully marked, and it was not until I\\nopened one two days later to find inside an embryo at least two weeks\\nold, that I realized that penguins added baby-snatching to their other\\nimmoralities. Some of those from whom I took eggs sat upon stones of a\\nsimilar size and shape with every appearance of content: one sat upon the\\nhalf of the red tin of a Dutch cheese. They are not very intelligent.\\nAll the world loves a penguin: I think it is because in many respects\\nthey are like ourselves, and in some respects what we should like to be.\\nHad we but half their physical courage none could stand against us. Had\\nwe a hundredth part of their maternal instinct we should have to kill our\\nchildren by the thousand. Their little bodies are so full of curiosity\\nthat they have no room for fear. They like mountaineering, and joy-riding\\non ice-floes: they even like to drill.\\nOne day there had been a blizzard, and lying open to the view of all was\\na deserted nest, a pile of coveted stones. All the surrounding rookery\\nmade their way to and fro, each husband acquiring merit, for, after each\\njourney, he gave his wife a stone. This was the plebeian way of doing\\nthings; but my friend who stood, ever so unconcerned, upon a rock knew a\\ntrick worth two of that: he and his wife who sat so cosily upon the other\\nside.\\nThe victim was a third penguin. He was without a mate, but this was an\\nopportunity to get one. With all the speed his little legs could compass\\nhe ran to and fro, taking stones from the deserted nest, laying them\\nbeneath a rock, and hurrying back for more. On that same rock was my\\nfriend. When the victim came up with his stone he had his back turned.\\nBut as soon as the stone was laid and the other gone for more, he jumped\\ndown, seized it with his beak, ran round, gave it to his wife and was\\nback on the rock (with his back turned) before you could say Killer\\nWhale. Every now and then he looked over his shoulder, to see where the\\nnext stone might be.\\nI watched this for twenty minutes. All that time, and I do not know for\\nhow long before, that wretched bird was bringing stone after stone. And\\nthere were no stones there. Once he looked puzzled, looked up and swore\\nat the back of my friend on his rock, but immediately he came back, and\\nhe never seemed to think he had better stop. It was getting cold and I\\nwent away: he was coming for another.\\nThe life of an Ad\xe9lie penguin is one of the most unchristian and\\nsuccessful in the world. The penguin which went in for being a true\\nbeliever would never stand the ghost of a chance. Watch them go to bathe.\\nSome fifty or sixty agitated birds are gathered upon the ice-foot,\\npeering over the edge, telling one another how nice it will be, and what\\na good dinner they are going to have. But this is all swank: they are\\nreally worried by a horrid suspicion that a sea-leopard is waiting to eat\\nthe first to dive. The really noble bird, according to our theories,\\nwould say, \\"I will go first and if I am killed I shall at any rate have\\ndied unselfishly, sacrificing my life for my companions\\"; and in time\\nall the most noble birds would be dead. What they really do is to try and\\npersuade a companion of weaker mind to plunge: failing this, they hastily\\npass a conscription act and push him over. And then--bang,\\nhelter-skelter, in go all the rest.\\nThey take turns in sitting on their eggs, and after many days the fathers\\nmay be seen waddling down towards the sea with their shirt-fronts\\nmuddied, their long trick done. It may be a fortnight before they return,\\nwell-fed, clean, pleased with life, and with a grim determination to\\nrelieve their wives, to do their job. Sometimes they are met by others\\ngoing to bathe. They stop and pass the time of day. Well! Perhaps it\\nwould be more pleasant, and what does a day or two matter anyhow. They\\nturn; clean and dirty alike are off to the seaside again. This is when\\nthey say, \\"The women are splendid.\\"\\nLife is too strenuous for them to have any use for the virtues of\\nbrotherly love, good works, charity and benevolence. When they mate the\\nbest thief wins: when they nest the best pair of thieves hatch out their\\neggs. In a long unbroken stream, which stretches down below the sea-ice\\nhorizon, they march in from the open sea. Some are walking on their human\\nfeet: others tobogganing upon their shiny white breasts. After their long\\nwalk they must have a sleep, and then the gentlemen make their way into\\nthe already crowded rookery to find them wives. But first a suitor must\\nfind, or steal, a pebble, for such are the penguin jewels: they are of\\nlava, black, russet or grey, with almond-shaped crystals bedded in them.\\nThey are rare and of all sizes, but that which is most valued is the size\\nof a pigeon\'s egg. Armed with one of these he courts his maid, laying it\\nat her feet. If accepted he steals still more stones: she guards them\\njealously, taking in the meantime any safe opportunity to pick others\\nfrom under her nearest neighbours. Any penguin which is unable to fight\\nand steal successfully fails to make a good high nest, or loses it when\\nmade. Then comes a blizzard, and after that a thaw: for it thaws\\nsometimes right down by the sea-shore where the Ad\xe9lies have their\\nnurseries. The eggs of the strong and wicked hatch out, but those of the\\nweak are addled. You must have a jolly good pile of stones to hatch eggs\\nafter a blizzard like that in December 1911, when the rookeries were\\ncompletely snow-covered: nests, eggs, parents and all.\\nOnce hatched the chicks grow quickly from pretty grey atoms of down to\\nblack lumps of stomach topped by a small and quite inadequate head. They\\nare two or more weeks old, and they leave their parents, or their parents\\nleave them, I do not know which. If socialism be the nationalization of\\nthe means of production and distribution, then they are socialists. They\\ndivide into parents and children. The adult community comes up from the\\nopen sea, bringing food inside them: they are full of half-digested\\nshrimps. But not for their own children: these, if not already dead, are\\nlost in a crowd of hungry tottering infants which besiege each\\nfood-provider as he arrives. But not all of them can get food, though all\\nof them are hungry. Some have already been behindhand too long: they have\\nnot managed to secure food for days, and they are weak and cold and very\\nweary.","image":null},{"merge":"C20.06","output":"The passage describes the struggle for food among Ad\xe9lie penguin chicks, nature\'s harshness, and the relief of the author\'s team when their ship finally arrived.

The\\nparents were labouring under a totally different idea, and intended\\neither to find their own infants and feed them, or else to assimilate\\ntheir already partially digested catch themselves. The more robust of the\\nyoung thus worried an adult until, because of his importunity, he was\\nfed. But with the less robust a much more pathetic ending was the rule. A\\nchick that had fallen behind in this literal race for life, starving and\\nweak, and getting daily weaker because it could not run fast enough to\\ninsist on being fed, again and again ran off pursuing with the rest.\\nAgain and again it stumbled and fell, persistently whining out its hunger\\nin a shrill and melancholy pipe, till at last the race was given up.\\nForced thus by sheer exhaustion to stop and rest, it had no chance of\\ngetting food. Each hurrying parent with its little following of hungry\\nchicks, intent on one thing only, rushed quickly by, and the starveling\\ndropped behind to gather strength for one more effort. Again it fails, a\\nrobuster bird has forced the pace, and again success is wanting to the\\nrunt. Sleepily it stands there, with half-shut eyes, in a torpor\\nresulting from exhaustion, cold, and hunger, wondering perhaps what all\\nthe bustle round it means, a little dirty, dishevelled dot, in the race\\nfor life a failure, deserted by its parents, who have hunted vainly for\\ntheir own offspring round the nest in which they hatched it, but from\\nwhich it may by now have wandered half a mile. And so it stands, lost to\\neverything around, till a skua in its beat drops down beside it, and with\\na few strong, vicious pecks puts an end to the failing life.\\"[358]\\nThere is a great deal to be said for this kind of treatment. The Ad\xe9lie\\npenguin has a hard life: the Emperor penguin a horrible one. Why not kill\\noff the unfit right away, before they have had time to breed, almost\\nbefore they have had time to eat? Life is a stern business in any case:\\nwhy pretend that it is anything else? Or that any but the best can\\nsurvive at all? And in consequence, I challenge you to find a more jolly,\\nhappy, healthy lot of old gentlemen in the world. We _must_ admire them:\\nif only because they are so much nicer than ourselves! But it is grim:\\nNature is an uncompromising nurse.\\nNature was going to give us a bad time too if we were not relieved, and\\non January 17, as there were still no signs of the ship, it was decided\\nto prepare for another winter. We were to go on rations; to cook with\\noil, for nearly all the coal was gone; to kill and store up seal. On\\nJanuary 18 we started our preparations, digging a cave to store more\\nmeat, and so forth. I went off seal hunting after breakfast, and having\\nkilled and cut up two, came back across the Cape at mid-day. All the men\\nwere out working in the camp. There was nothing to be seen in the Sound,\\nand then, quite suddenly, the bows of the ship came out from behind the\\nend of the Barne Glacier, two or three miles away. We watched her\\ncautious approach with immense relief.\\n\\"Are you all well,\\" through a megaphone from the bridge.\\n\\"The Polar Party died on their return from the Pole: we have their\\nrecords.\\" A pause and then a boat.\\nEvans, who had been to England and made a good recovery from scurvy, was\\nin command: with him were Pennell, Rennick, Bruce, Lillie and Drake. They\\nreported having had a very big gale indeed on their way home last year.\\nWe got some apples off the ship, \\"beauties, I want nothing better....\\nPennell is first-class, as always....\\" \\"One notices among the ship\'s men\\na rather unnatural way of talking: not so much in special instances, but\\nas a whole, contact with civilization gives it an affected sound: I\\nnotice it in both officers and men.\\"[359]\\n\\"_January 19.

It is quite wonderful now to be\\ntravelling a day\'s journey in an hour: we went to Cape Royds in about\\nthat time and took off geological and zoological specimens. I should like\\nto sit up and sketch all these views, which would have meant long\\ntravelling without the ship, but I feel very tired. The mail is almost\\ntoo good for words.

On the\\narrival of the ship the carpenter immediately set to work to make a great\\ncross of jarrah wood. There was some discussion as to the inscription, it\\nbeing urged that there should be some quotation from the Bible because\\n\\"the women think a lot of these things.\\" But I was glad to see the\\nconcluding line of Tennyson\'s \\"Ulysses\\" adopted: \\"To strive, to seek, to\\nfind, and not to yield.\\"\\nThe open water stretched about a mile and a half south of Tent Island,\\nand here we left the ship to sledge the cross to Hut Point at 8 A.M. on\\nJanuary 20. The party consisted of Atkinson, Wright, Lashly, Crean,\\nDebenham, Keohane and Davies, the ship\'s carpenter and myself.\\n\\"_Evening. Hut Point._ We had a most unpleasant experience coming in. We\\nstruck wind and drift just about a mile from Hut Point: then we saw there\\nwas a small thaw pool off the Point, and came out to give it a wide\\nberth. Atkinson put his feet down into water: we turned sharp out, and\\nthen Crean went right in up to his arms, and we realized that the ice was\\nnot more than three or four inches of slush. I managed to give him a hand\\nout without the ice giving, and we went on floundering about. Then Crean\\nwent right in again, and the sledge nearly went too: we pulled the\\nsledge, and the sledge pulled him out. Except for some more soft patches\\nthat was all, but it was quite enough. I think we got out of it most\\nfortunately.\\"\\n\\"Crean got some dry clothes here, and the cross has had a coat of white\\npaint and is drying. We went up Observation Hill and have found a good\\nspot right on the top, and have already dug a hole which will, with the\\nrock alongside, give us three feet. From there we can see that this\\nyear\'s old ice is in a terrible state, open water and open water slush\\nall over near the land--I have never seen anything like it here. Off Cape\\nArmitage and at the Pram Point pressure it is extra bad. I only hope we\\ncan find a safe way back.\\"\\n\\"You would not think Crean had had such a pair of duckings to hear him\\ntalking so merrily to-night....\\"\\n\\"I really do think the cross is going to look fine.\\"[361]\\nObservation Hill was clearly the place for it, it knew them all so well.\\nThree of them were Discovery men who lived three years under its shadow:\\nthey had seen it time after time as they came back from hard journeys on\\nthe Barrier: Observation Hill and Castle Rock were the two which always\\nwelcomed them in. It commanded McMurdo Sound on one side, where they had\\nlived: and the Barrier on the other, where they had died. No more fitting\\npedestal, a pedestal which in itself is nearly 1000 feet high, could have\\nbeen found.\\n\\"_Tuesday, January 22._ Rousing out at 6 A.M. we got the large piece of\\nthe cross up Observation Hill by 11 A.M. It was a heavy job, and the ice\\nwas looking very bad all round, and I for one was glad when we had got it\\nup by 5 o\'clock or so. It is really magnificent, and will be a permanent\\nmemorial which could be seen from the ship nine miles off with a naked\\neye. It stands nine feet out of the rocks, and many feet into the ground,\\nand I do not believe it will ever move. When it was up, facing out over\\nthe Barrier, we gave three cheers and one more.\\"\\nWe got back to the ship all right and coasted up the Western Mountains to\\nGranite Harbour; a wonderfully interesting trip to those of us who had\\nonly seen these mountains from a distance.

Here were all\\nkinds of sponges, siliceous, glass rope, tubular, and they were generally\\ncovered with mucus. Some fed on diatoms so minute that they can only be\\ncollected by centrifuge: some have gastric juices to dissolve the\\nsiliceous skeletons of the diatoms on which they feed: they anchor\\nthemselves in the mud and pass water in and out of their bodies:\\nsometimes the current is stimulated by cilia. There were colonies of\\nGorgonacea, which share their food unselfishly; and corals and marine\\ndegenerate worms, which started to live in little cells like coral, but\\nhave gone down in the world. And there were starfishes, sea-urchins,\\nbrittle-stars, feather-stars and sea-cucumbers. The sea-urchins are\\nformed of hexagonal plates, the centre of each of which is a ball, upon\\nwhich a spine works on a ball and socket joint. These spines are used for\\nprotection, and when large they can be used for locomotion. But the real\\nmeans of locomotion are five double rows of water-tube feet, working by\\nsuction, by which they withdraw the water inside a receptacle in the\\nshell, thereby forming a vacuum; starfishes do the same. We found a\\nspecies of sea-urchin which had such large spines that they practically\\nformed bars; the spines were twice as long as the sea-urchin and shaped\\njust like oars, being even fluted. A lobster grows by discarding his\\nsuit, hiding and getting another, growing meanwhile. A snail or an oyster\\nretains his original shell, and adds to it in layers all the way down,\\nincreasing one edge. But our sea-urchin grows by an increment of\\ncalcareous matter all round the outside of each plate. As the animal\\ngrows the plates get bigger.\\nThere was a sea-cucumber which nurses its young, having a brood cavity\\nwhich is really formed out of the mouth: this is a peculiarity of a new\\nAntarctic genus found first on the Discovery. It has the most complex\\nwater-tubes, which it uses as legs, and a few limy rods in its soft skin\\ninstead of the bony calcareous plates of sea-urchins and starfish. After\\nthem came the feather-stars, a relic of the old crinoids which used to\\nflourish in the carboniferous period, examples of which can be found in\\nthe Derbyshire limestone; and there were thousands of brittle-stars, like\\nbeautiful wheels of which the hubs and spokes remained, but not the\\ncircumference. These spokes or legs are muscular, sensory and locomotive;\\nthey differ from the starfishes in that they have no digestive glands in\\ntheir legs, and from the feather-stars in that they do not use their legs\\nto waft food into their mouths. Once upon a time they had a stalk and\\nwere anchored to a rock, and there are still very rare old stalked\\nechinoderms living in the sea. This apparently geological thing was found\\nby Wyville Thomson in 1868 still living in the seas to the north of\\nScotland, and this find started the Challenger Expedition for deep-sea\\nsoundings in 1872. But the Challenger brought back little in this line.\\nMost of the species we found were peculiar to the Antarctic.\\nThere were Polychaete worms by the hundred, showing the protrusable\\nmouth, which is shoved into the mud and then brought back into the body,\\nand the bristles on the highly developed projections which act as legs,\\nby which they get about the mud. These beasts have apparently given rise\\nto the Arthropods. In a modified and later form they had taken to living\\nin a tube, both for protection and because they found that they could not\\ngo through the mud, which had become too viscous for them. So they stand\\nup in a tube and collect the sediment which is falling by means of\\ntentacles. They spread from one locality to another by going through a\\nplankton embryonic stage in their youth. They may be compared to the\\nmason worms, which also build tubes.\\nBut as Lillie squatted on the poop surrounded by an inner ring of jars\\nand tangled masses of the catch, and an outer ring of curious scientists,\\npseudo-scientists and seamen, no find pleased him so much as the frequent\\ndiscovery of pieces of Cephalodiscus rarus, of which even now there are\\nbut some four jars full in the world. It is as interesting as it is\\nuncommon, for its ancestor was a link between the vertebrates and\\ninvertebrates, though no one knows what it was like. It has been a\\nvertebrate and gone back, and now has the signs of a notochord in early\\nlife, and it also has gills. First found on the Graham\'s Land side of the\\nAntarctic continent, it has only recently been discovered in the Ross\\nSea, and occurs nowhere else in the world so far as is known.\\nWe left Granite Harbour in the early morning of January 23, and started\\nto make our way out. Our next job was to pick up the geological specimens\\nat Evans Coves, where Campbell and his men had wintered in the igloo, and\\nalso to leave a dep\xf4t there for future explorers. We met very heavy pack,\\nhaving to return at least twelve miles and try another way. \\"The sea has\\nbeen freezing out here, which seems an extraordinary thing at this time\\nof year. There was a thin layer of ice over the water between the floes\\nthis morning, and I feel sure that most of these big level floes, of\\nwhich we have seen several, are the remains of ice which has frozen\\ncomparatively recently.\\"[362] The propeller had a bad time, constantly\\ncatching up on ice. At length we were some thirty miles north of Cape\\nBird making roughly towards Franklin Island. That night we made good\\nprogress in fairly open water, and we passed Franklin Island during the\\nday. But the outlook was so bad in the evening (January 24) that we\\nstopped and banked fires. \\"We lay just where we stopped until at 5 A.M.\\non January 25, when the ice eased up sufficiently for us to get along,\\nand we started to make the same slow progress--slow ahead, stop (to the\\nengine-room)--bump and grind for a bit--then slow astern, stop--slow\\nahead again, and so on, until at 7 P.M., after one real big bump which\\nbrought the dinner some inches off the table, Cheetham brought us out\\ninto open water.\\"[363]\\nMount Nansen rose sheer and massive ahead of us with a table top, and at\\n3 A.M. on January 26 we were passing the dark brown granite headland of\\nthe northern foothills. We were soon made fast to a stretch of some 500\\nyards of thick sea-ice, upon which the wind had not left a particle of\\nsnow, and before us the foothills formed that opening which Campbell had\\nwell named Hell\'s Gate.\\nI wish I had seen that igloo: with its black and blubber and beastliness.\\nThose who saw it came back with faces of amazement and admiration. We\\nleft a dep\xf4t at the head of the bay, marked with a bamboo and a flag, and\\nthen we turned homewards, counting the weeks, and days, and then the\\nhours. In the early hours of January 27 we left the pack. On January 29\\nwe were off Cape Adare, \\"head sea, and wind, and fog, very ticklish work\\ngroping along hardly seeing the ship\'s length. Then it lifts and there is\\na fair horizon. Everybody pretty sea-sick, including most of the seamen\\nfrom Cape Evans. All of us feeling rotten.\\"[364] Very thick that night,\\nand difficult going. At mid-day (lat. 69\xb0 50\xb4 S.) a partial clearance\\nshowed a berg right ahead. By night it was blowing a full gale, and it\\nwas not too easy to keep in our bunks. Our object was now to make east in\\norder to allow for the westerlies later on. We passed a very large number\\nof bergs, varied every now and then by growlers. On February 1, latitude\\n64\xb0 15\xb4 S. and longitude 159\xb0 15\xb4 E., we coasted along one side of a\\nberg which was twenty-one geographical miles long: the only other side of\\nwhich we got a good view stretched away until lost below the horizon. In\\nlatitude 62\xb0 10\xb4 S. and longitude 158\xb0 15\xb4 E. we had \\"a real bad day:\\nhead wind from early morning, and simply crowds of bergs all round. At 8\\nA.M. we had to wedge in between a berg and a long line of pack before we\\ncould find a way through. Then thick fog came down. At 9.45 A.M. I went\\nout of the ward-room door, and almost knocked my head against a great\\nberg which was just not touching the ship on the starboard side. There\\nwas a heavy cross-swell, and the sea sounded cold as it dashed against\\nthe ice. After crossing the deck it was just possible to see in the fog\\nthat there was a great Barrier berg just away on the port side.\\" We\\ngroped round the starboard berg to find others beyond. Our friend on the\\nopposite side was continuous and apparently without end. It was soon\\nclear that we were in a narrow alley-way--between one very large berg and\\na number of others. It took an hour and a quarter of groping to leave the\\nbig berg behind. At 4 P.M., six hours later, we were still just feeling\\nour way along.

Also it was of the first importance that the\\nrelatives should be informed of the facts before the newspapers published\\nthem.\\nAnd so at 2.30 A.M. on February 10 we crept like a phantom ship into the\\nlittle harbour of Oamaru on the east coast of New Zealand. With what\\nmixed feelings we smelt the old familiar woods and grassy slopes, and saw\\nthe shadowy outlines of human homes. With untiring persistence the little\\nlighthouse blinked out the message, \\"What ship\'s that?\\" \\"What ship\'s\\nthat?\\" They were obviously puzzled and disturbed at getting no answer. A\\nboat was lowered and Pennell and Atkinson were rowed ashore and landed.\\nThe seamen had strict orders to answer no questions. After a little the\\nboat returned, and Crean announced: \\"We was chased, sorr, but they got\\nnothing out of us.\\"\\nWe put out to sea.\\nWhen morning broke we could see the land in the distance--greenness,\\ntrees, every now and then a cottage. We began to feel impatient. We\\nunpacked the shore-going clothes with their creases three years old which\\nhad been sent out from home, tried them on--and they felt unpleasantly\\ntight. We put on our boots, and they were positively agony. We shaved off\\nour beards! There was a hiatus. There was nothing to do but sail up and\\ndown the coast and, if possible, avoid coastwise craft.\\nIn the evening the little ship which runs daily from Akaroa to Lyttelton\\nput out to sea on her way and ranged close alongside. \\"Are all well?\\"\\n\\"Where\'s Captain Scott?\\" \\"Did you reach the Pole?\\" Rather unsatisfactory\\nanswers and away they went. Our first glimpse, however, of civilized\\nlife.\\nAt dawn the next morning, with white ensign at half-mast, we crept\\nthrough Lyttelton Heads. Always we looked for trees, people and houses.\\nHow different it was from the day we left and yet how much the same: as\\nthough we had dreamed some horrible nightmare and could scarcely believe\\nwe were not dreaming still.\\nThe Harbour-master came out in the tug and with him Atkinson and Pennell.\\n\\"Come down here a minute,\\" said Atkinson to me, and \\"It\'s made a\\ntremendous impression, I had no idea it would make so much,\\" he said. And\\nindeed we had been too long away, and the whole thing was so personal to\\nus, and our perceptions had been blunted: we never realized. We landed to\\nfind the Empire--almost the civilized world--in mourning. It was as\\nthough they had lost great friends.\\nTo a sensitive pre-war world the knowledge of these men\'s deaths came as\\na great shock: and now, although the world has almost lost the sense of\\ntragedy, it appeals to their pity and their pride. The disaster may well\\nbe the first thing which Scott\'s name recalls to your mind (as though an\\nevent occurred in the life of Columbus which caused you to forget that he\\ndiscovered America); but Scott\'s reputation is not founded upon the\\nconquest of the South Pole. He came to a new continent, found out how to\\ntravel there, and gave knowledge of it to the world: he discovered the\\nAntarctic, and founded a school. He is the last of the great geographical\\nexplorers: it is useless to try and light a fire when everything has been\\nburned; and he is probably the last old-fashioned polar explorer, for, as\\nI believe, the future of such exploration is in the air, but not yet. And\\nhe was strong: we never realized until we found him lying there dead how\\nstrong, mentally and physically, that man was.\\nIn both his polar expeditions he was helped, to an extent which will\\nnever be appreciated, by Wilson: in the last expedition by Bowers. I\\nbelieve that there has never been a finer sledge party than these three\\nmen, who combined in themselves initiative, endurance and high ideals to\\nan extraordinary degree. And they could organize: they did organize the\\nPolar Journey and their organization seemed to have failed. Did it fail?\\nScott said No. \\"The causes of this disaster are not due to faulty\\norganization, but to misfortune in all risks which had to be undertaken.\\"\\nNine times out of ten, says the meteorologist, he would have come\\nthrough: but he struck the tenth. \\"We took risks, we knew we took them;\\nthings have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for\\ncomplaint.\\" No better epitaph has been written.\\nHe decided to use the only route towards the Pole of which the world had\\nany knowledge, that is to go up the Beardmore Glacier, then the only\\ndiscovered way up through the mountains which divide the polar plateau\\nfrom the Great Ice Barrier: probably it is the only possible passage for\\nthose who travel from McMurdo Sound. The alternative was to winter on the\\nBarrier, as Amundsen did, so many hundred miles away from the coast-line\\nthat, in travelling south, the chaos caused in the ice plain by the\\nBeardmore in its outward flow would be avoided. To do so meant the\\nabandonment of a great part of the scientific programme, and Scott was\\nnot a man to go south just to reach the Pole. Amundsen knew that Scott\\nwas going to McMurdo Sound when he decided to winter in the Bay of\\nWhales: otherwise he might have gone to McMurdo Sound. Probably no man\\nwould have refused the knowledge which had already been gained.\\nI have said that there are those who say that Scott should have relied on\\nski and dogs. If you read Shackleton\'s account of his discovery and\\npassage of the Beardmore Glacier you will not be prejudiced in favour of\\ndogs: and as a matter of fact, though we found a much better way up than\\nShackleton, I do not believe it possible to take dogs up and down, and\\nover the ice disturbances at the junction with the plateau, unless there\\nis ample time to survey a route, if then. \\"Dogs could certainly have\\ncome up as far as this,\\" I heard Scott say somewhere under the\\nCloudmaker, approximately half-way up the glacier, but the best thing you\\ncould do with dogs in pressure such as we all experienced on our way down\\nwould be to drop them into the nearest chasm. If you can avoid such\\nmesses well and good: if not, you must not rely on dogs, and the people\\nwho talk of these things have no knowledge.\\nIf Scott was going up the Beardmore he was probably right not to take\\ndogs: actually he relied on ponies to the foot of the glacier and\\nman-haulage on from that point. Because he relied on ponies he was not\\nable to start before November: the experience of the Dep\xf4t Journey showed\\nthat ponies could not stand the weather conditions before that date. But\\nhe could have started earlier if he had taken dogs, in place of ponies,\\nto the foot of the glacier. This would have gained him a few days in his\\nrace against the autumn conditions when returning.\\nSuch tragedies inevitably raise the question, \\"Is it worth it?\\" What is\\nworth what? Is life worth risking for a feat, or losing for your country?\\nTo face a thing because it was a feat, and only a feat, was not very\\nattractive to Scott: it had to contain an additional object--knowledge. A\\nfeat had even less attraction for Wilson, and it is a most noteworthy\\nthing in the diaries which are contained in this book, that he made no\\ncomment when he found that the Norwegians were first at the Pole: it is\\nas though he felt that it did not really matter, as indeed it probably\\ndid not.\\nIt is most desirable that some one should tackle these and kindred\\nquestions about polar life. There is a wealth of matter in polar\\npsychology: there are unique factors here, especially the complete\\nisolation, and four months\' darkness every year. Even in Mesopotamia a\\nlong-suffering nation insisted at last that adequate arrangements must be\\nmade to nurse and evacuate the sick and wounded. But at the Poles a man\\nmust make up his mind that he may be rotting of scurvy (as Evans was) or\\nliving for ten months on half-rations of seal and full rations of\\nptomaine poisoning (as Campbell and his men were) but no help can reach\\nhim from the outside world for a year, if then. There is no chance of a\\n\'cushy\' wound: if you break your leg on the Beardmore you must consider\\nthe most expedient way of committing suicide, both for your own sake and\\nthat of your companions.","image":null},{"merge":"C20.09","output":"The passage discusses the mental and physical challenges that polar explorers face, including starvation, cramped living conditions, and blizzards.

To what extent can hard work, or what may be called dramatic\\nimagination, provide a substitute? Compare our thoughts on the march; our\\nfood dreams at night; the primitive way in which the loss of a crumb of\\nbiscuit may give a lasting sense of grievance.

Life in\\nsuch surroundings is both mentally and physically cramped; open-air\\nexercise is restricted and in blizzards quite impossible, and you realize\\nhow much you lose by your inability to see the world about you when you\\nare out-of-doors. I am told that when confronted by a lunatic or one who\\nunder the influence of some great grief or shock contemplates suicide,\\nyou should take that man out-of-doors and walk him about: Nature will do\\nthe rest. To normal people like ourselves living under abnormal\\ncircumstances Nature could do much to lift our thoughts out of the rut of\\neveryday affairs, but she loses much of her healing power when she cannot\\nbe seen, but only felt, and when that feeling is intensely uncomfortable.\\nSomehow in judging polar life you must discount compulsory endurance; and\\nfind out what a man can shirk, remembering always that it is a sledging\\nlife which is the hardest test. It is because it is so much easier to\\nshirk in civilization that it is difficult to get a standard of what your\\naverage man can do. It does not really matter much whether your man\\nwhose work lies in or round the hut shirks a bit or not, just as it does\\nnot matter much in civilization: it is just rather a waste of\\nopportunity. But there\'s precious little shirking in Barrier sledging: a\\nweek finds most of us out.\\nThere are many questions which ought to be studied. The effect upon men\\nof going from heat to cold, such as Bowers coming to us from the Persian\\nGulf: or vice versa of Simpson returning from the Antarctic to India;\\ndifferences of dry and damp cold; what is a comfortable temperature in\\nthe Antarctic and what is it compared to a comfortable temperature in\\nEngland, the question of women in these temperatures...? The man with the\\nnerves goes farthest. What is the ratio between nervous and physical\\nenergy? What is vitality? Why do some things terrify you at one time and\\nnot at others? What is this early morning courage? What is the influence\\nof imagination? How far can a man draw on his capital? Whence came\\nBowers\' great heat supply? And my own white beard? and X\'s blue eyes: for\\nhe started from England with brown ones and his mother refused to own him\\nwhen he came back? Growth and colour change in hair and skin?\\nThere are many reasons which send men to the Poles, and the Intellectual\\nForce uses them all. But the desire for knowledge for its own sake is the\\none which really counts and there is no field for the collection of\\nknowledge which at the present time can be compared to the Antarctic.\\nExploration is the physical expression of the Intellectual Passion.\\nAnd I tell you, if you have the desire for knowledge and the power to\\ngive it physical expression, go out and explore. If you are a brave man\\nyou will do nothing: if you are fearful you may do much, for none but\\ncowards have need to prove their bravery. Some will tell you that you are\\nmad, and nearly all will say, \\"What is the use?\\" For we are a nation of\\nshopkeepers, and no shopkeeper will look at research which does not\\npromise him a financial return within a year.

An Antarctic blizzard is a high southerly wind generally\\naccompanied by clouds of drifting snow, partly falling from above, partly\\npicked up from the surface. In the daylight of summer a tent cannot be\\nseen a few yards off: in the darkness of winter it is easy to be lost\\nwithin a few feet of a hut. There is no doubt that a blizzard has a\\nbewildering and numbing effect upon the brain of any one exposed to it.\\nBRASH. Small ice fragments from a floe which is breaking up.\\nCLOUD. The commonest form of cloud, and also that typical of blizzard\\nconditions, was a uniform pall stretching all over the sky without\\ndistinction. This was logged by us as _stratus_. _Cumulus_ clouds are the\\nwoolly billows, flat below and rounded on top, which are formed by local\\nascending currents of air. They were rare in the south and only formed\\nover open water or mountains. _Cirrus_ are the \\"mare\'s tails\\" and similar\\nwispy clouds which float high in the atmosphere. These and their allied\\nforms were common. Generally speaking, the clouds were due to\\nstratification of the air into layers rather than to ascending currents.\\nCRUSTS. Layers of snow in a snow-field with air space between them.\\nFINNESKO. Boots made entirely of fur, soles and all.\\nFROST SMOKE. Condensed water vapour which forms a mist over open sea in\\ncold weather.\\nICE-FOOT. Fringes of ice which skirt many parts of the Antarctic shores:\\nmany of them have been formed by sea-spray.\\nNUNATAK. An island of land in a snow-field. Buckley Island is the top of\\na mountain sticking out of the top of the Beardmore Glacier.\\nPIEDMONT. Stretches of ancient ice which remain along the Antarctic\\ncoasts.\\nPRAM. A Norwegian skiff, with a spoon bow.\\nSAENNEGRASS. A kind of Norwegian hay used as packing in finnesko.\\nSASTRUGI are the furrows or irregularities formed on a snow plain by the\\nwind. They may be a foot or more deep and as hard and as slippery as\\nice: they may be quite soft: they may appear as great inverted pudding\\nbowls: they may be hard knots covered with soft powdery snow.\\nSLEDGING DISTANCES. All miles are geographical miles unless otherwise\\nstated, 1 statute or English mile = 0.87 geographical mile: 1\\ngeographical mile = 1.15 statute miles.\\nTANK. A canvas \\"hold-all\\" strapped to the sledge to contain food bags.\\nTIDE CRACK. A working crack between the land ice and the sea ice which\\nrises and falls with the tide.\\nWIND. Wind forces are logged according to the Beaufort scale, which is as\\nfollows:","image":null},{"merge":"C20.10","output":"{\\n\\"summary\\": \\"A table of mean velocity in miles per hour accompanies an index of keywords, people, and locations relevant to a nonfiction book about early exploration of the Antarctic region.\\",\\n\\"excerpt_1\\": \\"Atkinson, Edward L., lost in blizzard, 303\\",\\n\\"excerpt_2\\": \\"Dogs, on board ship, 49\\",\\n\\"text_to_image\\": \\"A table with 13 rows and 3 columns featuring the numbers 0-12 on the left-most column, and \'Description\' and \'Mean velocity in miles per hour\' on the remaining two columns respectively.\\" \\n}","parsed":{"summary":"A table of mean velocity in miles per hour accompanies an index of keywords, people, and locations relevant to a nonfiction book about early exploration of the Antarctic region.","excerpt_1":"Atkinson, Edward L., lost in blizzard, 303","excerpt_2":"Dogs, on board ship, 49","text_to_image":"A table with 13 rows and 3 columns featuring the numbers 0-12 on the left-most column, and \'Description\' and \'Mean velocity in miles per hour\' on the remaining two columns respectively."},"passage":"                             Mean velocity\\nNo.     Description.        in miles per hour.\\n 0.

Loomings.\\n\\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago\u2014never mind how long precisely\u2014having\\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\\nmethodically knocking people\u2019s hats off\u2014then, I account it high time to\\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\\n\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her\\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\\n\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\\ndo you see?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\u2014tied to\\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\\n\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand\u2014miles of\\nthem\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\\nand avenues\u2014north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\\nthose ships attract them thither?\\n\\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\\nreveries\u2014stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\\never.\\n\\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\\nshepherd\u2019s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\u2019s eye were\\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\\nTiger-lilies\u2014what is the one charm wanting?\u2014Water\u2014there is not a drop\\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\\nyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\\n\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\\nget sea-sick\u2014grow quarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do not enjoy\\nthemselves much, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger;\\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\\nAnd as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory\\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I\\nnever fancied broiling fowls;\u2014though once broiled, judiciously\\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\\n\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\u2019s sense of honor,\\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\\nin time.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator, Ishmael, shares his reasons for going to sea and muses on humanity\'s attraction to water, which he sees as a representation of life\'s ungraspable phantom.","excerpt_1":"There is magic in it.

On the contrary, passengers themselves must\\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\\npaid_,\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\\naccount can a monied man enter heaven.

But\\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\\nsome unaccountable way\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And,\\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\\nsomething like this:\\n\\n\u201c_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\\n\u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \u201cBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\u201d\\n\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces\u2014though I\\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\\nand discriminating judgment.\\n\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it\u2014would they let\\nme\u2014since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\\nthe place one lodges in.\\n\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator muses on being a sailor, the discomfort of paying versus being paid, and his desire to voyage to find the mysterious great whale.

The Carpet-Bag.\\n\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\\n\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\\nwas her great original\u2014the Tyre of this Carthage;\u2014the place where the\\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\\nimported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in\\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\\nbowsprit?\\n\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So,\\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\\nnorth with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you\\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\\ninquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular.\\n\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \u201cThe\\nCrossed Harpoons\u201d\u2014but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\\non, from the bright red windows of the \u201cSword-Fish Inn,\u201d there came\\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,\u2014rather weary for me,\\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\u2019t\\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\\nthe cheeriest inns.\\n\\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\\nGomorrah? But \u201cThe Crossed Harpoons,\u201d and \u201cThe Sword-Fish?\u201d\u2014this, then\\nmust needs be the sign of \u201cThe Trap.\u201d However, I picked myself up and\\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\\ndoor.\\n\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\\npreacher\u2019s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \u2018The Trap!\u2019\\n\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\\nunderneath\u2014\u201cThe Spouter Inn:\u2014Peter Coffin.\u201d\\n\\nCoffin?\u2014Spouter?\u2014Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\\n\\nIt was a queer sort of place\u2014a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\\never it did about poor Paul\u2019s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\\nhob quietly toasting for bed. \u201cIn judging of that tempestuous wind\\ncalled Euroclydon,\u201d says an old writer\u2014of whose works I possess the\\nonly copy extant\u2014\u201cit maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\\nglazier.\u201d True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\\nmind\u2014old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn\u2019t\\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\\nhere and there. But it\u2019s too late to make any improvements now. The\\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\\nwrapper\u2014(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\\n\\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\\norder to keep out this frost?\\n\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.","parsed":{"summary":"Ishmael arrives in New Bedford, intending to sail to Nantucket, but discovers he must wait until Monday.

The Spouter-Inn.\\n\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\\n\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.\u2014It\u2019s the Black Sea in a midnight\\ngale.\u2014It\u2019s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.\u2014It\u2019s a\\nblasted heath.\u2014It\u2019s a Hyperborean winter scene.\u2014It\u2019s the breaking-up of\\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\\nthat one portentous something in the picture\u2019s midst. _That_ once found\\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\\n\\nIn fact, the artist\u2019s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\n\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\\nharpoon\u2014so like a corkscrew now\u2014was flung in Javan seas, and run away\\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\\n\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way\u2014cut\\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\nfireplaces all round\u2014you enter the public room. A still duskier place\\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft\u2019s\\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\\ngathered from this wide world\u2019s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den\u2014the bar\u2014a rude\\nattempt at a right whale\u2019s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\\nvast arched bone of the whale\u2019s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\\nthe sailors deliriums and death.\\n\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\\ncylinders without\u2014within, the villanous green goggling glasses\\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\u2019 goblets. Fill to\\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\\nand so on to the full glass\u2014the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\\ndown for a shilling.\\n\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\\na room, received for answer that his house was full\u2014not a bed\\nunoccupied. \u201cBut avast,\u201d he added, tapping his forehead, \u201cyou haint no\\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer\u2019s blanket, have ye? I s\u2019pose you are\\ngoin\u2019 a-whalin\u2019, so you\u2019d better get used to that sort of thing.\u201d\\n\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\\nthe half of any decent man\u2019s blanket.\\n\\n\u201cI thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?\u2014you want supper?\\nSupper\u2019ll be ready directly.\u201d\\n\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\\nhe didn\u2019t make much headway, I thought.\\n\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland\u2014no fire at all\u2014the landlord said\\nhe couldn\u2019t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\\nfare was of the most substantial kind\u2014not only meat and potatoes, but\\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\\nmanner.\\n\\n\u201cMy boy,\u201d said the landlord, \u201cyou\u2019ll have the nightmare to a dead\\nsartainty.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cLandlord,\u201d I whispered, \u201cthat aint the harpooneer is it?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \u201cthe\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.

Starting up, the landlord\\ncried, \u201cThat\u2019s the Grampus\u2019s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\\nthis morning; a three years\u2019 voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\\nwe\u2019ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\u201d\\n\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale\u2019s mouth\u2014the bar\u2014when the\\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.\\n\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\\ncapering about most obstreperously.\\n\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\\nthem, they raised a cry of \u201cBulkington! Bulkington! where\u2019s\\nBulkington?\u201d and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\\n\\nIt was now about nine o\u2019clock, and the room seeming almost\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\\nentrance of the seamen.\\n\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don\u2019t know how it is, but\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\\n\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\\nmidnight\u2014how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\\n\\n\u201cLandlord! I\u2019ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.\u2014I shan\u2019t sleep\\nwith him. I\u2019ll try the bench here.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cJust as you please; I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t spare ye a tablecloth for a\\nmattress, and it\u2019s a plaguy rough board here\u201d\u2014feeling of the knots and\\nnotches. \u201cBut wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\u2019ve got a carpenter\u2019s plane\\nthere in the bar\u2014wait, I say, and I\u2019ll make ye snug enough.\u201d So saying\\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\u2019s sake to quit\u2014the\\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\\nbrown study.\\n\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\nthan the planed one\u2014so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\\nnight.\\n\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\u2019t I steal\\na march on him\u2014bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\\n\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person\u2019s bed, I began\\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I\u2019ll wait awhile; he must be\\ndropping in before long. I\u2019ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all\u2014there\u2019s no telling.\\n\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\n\\n\u201cLandlord!\u201d said I, \u201cwhat sort of a chap is he\u2014does he always keep such\\nlate hours?\u201d It was now hard upon twelve o\u2019clock.\\n\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \u201cNo,\u201d he\\nanswered, \u201cgenerally he\u2019s an early bird\u2014airley to bed and airley to\\nrise\u2014yes, he\u2019s the bird what catches the worm.

But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag\u2019s mouth. This accomplished, however,\\nhe turned round\u2014when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it\u2019s just as I thought, he\u2019s a\\nterrible bedfellow; he\u2019s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\\nof a white man\u2014a whaleman too\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had\\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s only his outside; a man can be\\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\\nsun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\u2014a ghastly\\nthing enough\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\\nhat\u2014a new beaver hat\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\\nThere was no hair on his head\u2014none to speak of at least\u2014nothing but a\\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\\n\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years\u2019\\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too\u2014perhaps the heads of his own\\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine\u2014heavens! look at that tomahawk!\\n\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days\u2019 old\\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\\nor chapel for his Congo idol.\\n\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\\nill at ease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\n\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\\nI had so long been bound.\\n\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\\n\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\\nmeaning.\\n\\n\u201cWho-e debel you?\u201d\u2014he at last said\u2014\u201cyou no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\u201d\\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\\ndark.\\n\\n\u201cLandlord, for God\u2019s sake, Peter Coffin!\u201d shouted I. \u201cLandlord! Watch!\\nCoffin! Angels! save me!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSpeak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\u201d again growled the\\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\n\\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid now,\u201d said he, grinning again, \u201cQueequeg here wouldn\u2019t\\nharm a hair of your head.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cStop your grinning,\u201d shouted I, \u201cand why didn\u2019t you tell me that that\\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI thought ye know\u2019d it;\u2014didn\u2019t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\u2019 heads\\naround town?\u2014but turn flukes again and go to sleep.

The Counterpane.\\n\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\u2019s arm thrown\\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade\u2014owing I suppose to his\\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\u2014this same arm of his, I\\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\\nquilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\\n\\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other\u2014I\\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,\u2014my\\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\\nbed, though it was only two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\\n\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\\nand worse\u2014at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\\nslowly waking from it\u2014half steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the\\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\\noften puzzle myself with it.\\n\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\u2019s pagan arm\\nthrown round me. But at length all the past night\u2019s events soberly\\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm\u2014unlock his\\nbridegroom clasp\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\\nhim\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\\nsleeping by the savage\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the name of\\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\\na man like Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well\\nworth unusual regarding.\\n\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\\none, by the by, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his\\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\\nnext movement was to crush himself\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\u2014under the\\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\\nstage\u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\\nones\u2014probably not made to order either\u2014rather pinched and tormented him\\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator wakes up to find Queequeg hugging him tightly with his tattooed arm; the narrator\'s sensations are strange, and he reminisces about a childhood nightmare.

The Street.\\n\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\n\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\\nparts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\\nwill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\\nunknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\\nYankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\\nStreet and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\\nsailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\\ncorners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.\\n\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\\nand Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\\nwhich unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\\nmore curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\\nscores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\\nand glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\\nfellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\\nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\\nthey came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\\nLook there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\\nand swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\\nHere comes another with a sou\u2019-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\n\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one\u2014I mean a\\ndownright bumpkin dandy\u2014a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\\ncountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\\nreputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\\ncomical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\\nsea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\\ncanvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\\nstraps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\\nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\n\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\\nand bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a\\nqueer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would\\nthis day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of\\nLabrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\\none, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\\nlive in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\\nlike Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run\\nwith milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more\\npatrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New\\nBedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of\\na country?\\n\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\\nmansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\\noceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the\\nbottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\\n\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\\nthey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\\nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\n\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples\u2014long\\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\\nart; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright\\nterraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at\\ncreation\u2019s final day.\\n\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\\nroses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks\\nis perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.

I am sure that I did not.\\n\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\\nspecial errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\\nsleet and mist.

Entering, I found\\na small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors\u2019 wives and\\nwidows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks\\nof the storm.

Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a\\nwondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage\\nwas the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because\\nhe was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading\\nthose frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of\\nthe seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,\\nI knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,\\nand so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here\\nbefore me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of\\nthose bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed\\nafresh.\\n\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\\namong flowers can say\u2014here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the\\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these.

The Pulpit.\\n\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\\nadmitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\\nwrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\\nbloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February\u2019s snow. No\\none having previously heard his history, could for the first time\\nbehold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\\nadventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\\n\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\\nascending the main-top of his vessel.\\n\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\\nwood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\\nthe pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.\\n\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\\nself-containing stronghold\u2014a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\\nwell of water within the walls.\\n\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\nborrowed from the chaplain\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\u2019s\\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\\nship\u2019s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\\nthe Victory\u2019s plank where Nelson fell. \u201cAh, noble ship,\u201d the angel\\nseemed to say, \u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\\noff\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\u201d\\n\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\\nlikeness of a ship\u2019s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\u2019s fiddle-headed\\nbeak.\\n\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\u2014for the pulpit is ever this earth\u2019s\\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\\nworld.

Midships! midships!\u201d\\n\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\\nstill slighter shuffling of women\u2019s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\\nevery eye on the preacher.\\n\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\u2019s bows, folded his\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\\nat the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog\u2014in such tones he\\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\u2014\\n\\n\\n  \u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\\n  While all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\\n  to doom.\\n\\n  \u201cI saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;\\n  Which none but they that feel can tell\u2014 Oh, I was plunging to\\n  despair.\\n\\n  \u201cIn black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him\\n  mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014 No more the whale did me\\n  confine.\\n\\n  \u201cWith speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;\\n  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.\\n\\n  \u201cMy song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I\\n  give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\\nthe proper page, said: \u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\\nfirst chapter of Jonah\u2014\u2018And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\\nJonah.\u2019\u201d\\n\\n\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\u2014four yarns\u2014is one\\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\\ndepths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\\nthe fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\\ncommand of God\u2014never mind now what that command was, or how\\nconveyed\u2014which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\\nwould have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence, he\\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.\\n\\n\u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\\na ship that\u2019s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That\u2019s the opinion of learned men.\\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he\u2019s a fugitive! no\\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\u2014no friends accompany him\\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\u2019s\\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\\nstill serious way, one whispers to the other\u2014\u201cJack, he\u2019s robbed a\\nwidow;\u201d or, \u201cJoe, do you mark him; he\u2019s a bigamist;\u201d or, \u201cHarry lad, I\\nguess he\u2019s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\\none of the missing murderers from Sodom.\u201d Another runs to read the bill\\nthat\u2019s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\\nout his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Oh! how that harmless\\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\\nBut he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\\nsail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the\\nnext coming tide,\u2019 at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\\nhim. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\\npassenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab.

In\\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\\nfrontiers. So Jonah\u2019s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\u2019s\\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\\nand it\u2019s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\\npassage. \u2018Point out my state-room, Sir,\u2019 says Jonah now, \u2018I\u2019m\\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.\u2019 \u2018Thou lookest like it,\u2019 says the Captain,\\n\u2018there\u2019s thy room.\u2019 Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\\nconvicts\u2019 cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\\nbeneath the ship\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\\nhis bowels\u2019 wards.\\n\\n\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\noscillates in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in\\nme!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\\nsoul are all in crookedness!\u2019\\n\\n\u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\\nthere\u2019s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\\nJonah\u2019s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\\n\\n\u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\\ntrampling feet right over Jonah\u2019s head; in all this raging tumult,\\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\\nof the ship\u2014a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\\near, \u2018What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\u2019 Startled from his lethargy\\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\\ntormented deep.\\n\\n\u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah\u2019s; that discovered, then\\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. \u2018What is thine\\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\\nhand of God that is upon him.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018I am a Hebrew,\u2019 he cries\u2014and then\u2014\u2018I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land!\u2019 Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\\ndeserts,\u2014when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\\n\\n\u201cAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\\nunto the Lord out of the fish\u2019s belly. But observe his prayer, and\\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\\nlike Jonah.\u201d\\n\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\\nwhen describing Jonah\u2019s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\\n\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\n\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\\nwith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these\\nwords:","parsed":{"summary":"The captain charges Jonah three times the usual fare and checks his purse for forgeries, suspecting him of being a fugitive.

A Bosom Friend.\\n\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\\ntime. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the\\nstove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\\nlittle negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\\nhimself in his heathenish way.\\n\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\\nto the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\\npage\u2014as I fancied\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and\\ngiving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He\\nwould then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\\none each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\\n\\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\\nhideously marred about the face\u2014at least to my taste\u2014his countenance\\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\\nbearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\\nmore expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\\ndecide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\\none. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington\u2019s\\nhead, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\\n\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\\nnot know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\\ncalm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\\nwith the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\\nwas something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is\u2014which was the only\\nway he could get there\u2014thrown among people as strange to him as though\\nhe were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\\npreserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\\nperhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\\nso living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man\\ngives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the\\ndyspeptic old woman, he must have \u201cbroken his digester.\u201d\\n\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then\\nonly glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering\\nround the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the\\nstorm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of\\nstrange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\\nwould have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\\ndrew me. I\u2019ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\\nhas proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\\nreferring to his last night\u2019s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\\nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\\n\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\\nbe seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\\nregularly passing between us.\\n\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\u2019s\\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\\nleft us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\u2019s phrase, that we\\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\\ncountryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\\nthose old rules would not apply.\\n\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\u2019 pockets. I let them stay.\\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\\nthe paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\\notherwise.","parsed":{"summary":"After returning from the chapel, the narrator finds Queequeg sitting alone carving his idol and counting the pages of a book.

Biographical.\\n\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\\nSouth. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\n\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\\ngrass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg\u2019s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\\ntwo. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\\non the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins\u2014royal\\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\\nnourished in his untutored youth.\\n\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\u2019s bay, and Queequeg sought a\\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\u2019s influence\\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\\nlow tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\\nthe water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\\nits prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\\nwhen the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\\nclimbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\\ndeck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\\nhacked in pieces.\\n\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\\nQueequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage\u2014this\\nsea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain\u2019s cabin. They put him down\\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom\u2014so he told me\u2014he\\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\\nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\u2019s\\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\\nsailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\\nspent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\\nlost. Thought he, it\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians; I\u2019ll die a\\npagan.\\n\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\\nwore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\\nways about him, though now some time from home.\\n\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\\na coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\\nyet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\\nhad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\\npagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,\u2014as\\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\\nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\\nhad made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\\nsceptre now.\\n\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\\nmovements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\\naccompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\\nsame watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\\nevery hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\\nboth worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\\nwith the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\\n\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg\\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\\nwere sleeping.","parsed":{"summary":"Queequeg, a native of Rokovoko, desired to see more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two.

Wheelbarrow.\\n\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\\nfor a block, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my\\ncomrade\u2019s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\\nme and Queequeg\u2014especially as Peter Coffin\u2019s cock and bull stories\\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\\nwhom I now companied with.\\n\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\\ndown to \u201cthe Moss,\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\\nmuch\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\nstreets,\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\\nmowers, who go into the farmers\u2019 meadows armed with their own\\nscythes\u2014though in no wise obliged to furnish them\u2014even so, Queequeg,\\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\\n\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\\nthing\u2014though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\\nwhich to manage the barrow\u2014Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \u201cWhy,\u201d\\nsaid I, \u201cQueequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\\nthink. Didn\u2019t the people laugh?\u201d\\n\\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander\u2014from all accounts, a very\\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain\u2014this\\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg\u2019s sister, a\\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\\nguests were assembled at the bride\u2019s bamboo cottage, this Captain\\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\\nKing, Queequeg\u2019s father. Grace being said,\u2014for those people have their\\ngrace as well as we\u2014though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts\u2014Grace, I\\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\\nceremony, and thinking himself\u2014being Captain of a ship\u2014as having plain\\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King\u2019s own\\nhouse\u2014the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\\npunchbowl;\u2014taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. \u201cNow,\u201d said\\nQueequeg, \u201cwhat you tink now?\u2014Didn\u2019t our people laugh?\u201d\\n\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\\nfor ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\\nof all earthly effort.\\n\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!\u2014how I spurned that turnpike\\nearth!\u2014that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\\nwhich will permit no records.\\n\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\\nteeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\\nSo full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\\nbowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\\nbeings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\\nmore dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\\nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin\u2019s\\nhour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\\nhim in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\\nsent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\\nwhile Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\\nand passed it to me for a puff.\\n\\n\u201cCapting!

Look at it\u2014a mere hillock, and elbow of\\nsand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\\ndon\u2019t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\\nto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\\npieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\\ncross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\\nto get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\\noasis, three blades in a day\u2019s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\\nshoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\\nof by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\\nsometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\\n\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\\nswooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\\nIndian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\\nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\\nsame direction.

They first caught crabs and quohogs\\nin the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\\nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\\nBehring\u2019s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\\nmalicious assaults!\\n\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\\ntheir ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\\nso many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\\nand Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\\nadd Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\\noverswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\\ntwo thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer\u2019s.

Chowder.\\n\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\\nof the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\\nthe larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\\ninsisted that the yellow warehouse\u2014our first point of departure\u2014must be\\nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\\nit was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\\nthe dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\\nmistaking.\\n\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\u2019 ears,\\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\\nold doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\\nof crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\\n_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It\u2019s ominous, thinks\\nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen\u2019s chapel; and here a gallows!\\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\\noblique hints touching Tophet?\\n\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\\nshirt.\\n\\n\u201cGet along with ye,\u201d said she to the man, \u201cor I\u2019ll be combing ye!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cCome on, Queequeg,\u201d said I, \u201call right. There\u2019s Mrs. Hussey.\u201d\\n\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said\u2014\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that about Cods, ma\u2019am?\u201d said I, with much politeness.\\n\\n\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d she repeated.\\n\\n\u201cA clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\u201d\\nsays I, \u201cbut that\u2019s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\\ntime, ain\u2019t it, Mrs. Hussey?\u201d\\n\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\\nbut the word \u201cclam,\u201d Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\\nto the kitchen, and bawling out \u201cclam for two,\u201d disappeared.\\n\\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201cdo you think that we can make out a supper for us\\nboth on one clam?\u201d\\n\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\\ninto little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\\nseasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\\nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\\nfood before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\\nbethinking me of Mrs. Hussey\u2019s clam and cod announcement, I thought I\\nwould try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\\nthe word \u201ccod\u201d with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\\nmoments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\\nflavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\\n\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\\nto myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?

Chowder for\\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\\nbooks bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\\nmilk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\\nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen\u2019s\\nboats, I saw Hosea\u2019s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\\nmarching along the sand with each foot in a cod\u2019s decapitated head,\\nlooking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\n\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\\nhis harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said I;\\n\u201cevery true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon\u2014but why not?\u201d \u201cBecause\\nit\u2019s dangerous,\u201d says she. \u201cEver since young Stiggs coming from that\\nunfort\u2019nt v\u2019y\u2019ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\\nonly three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,\\nwith his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to\\ntake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night.

The Ship.\\n\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no\\nsmall concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\\ndiligently consulting Yojo\u2014the name of his black little god\u2014and Yojo\\nhad told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\\nto do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\\n\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast\\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\\ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\n\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\u2019s, or rather Yojo\u2019s, touching the selection\\nof our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\\nrelied upon Queequeg\u2019s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\\nrushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\\nwith Yojo in our little bedroom\u2014for it seemed that it was some sort of\\nLent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\\nQueequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\\nships up for three-years\u2019 voyages\u2014The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\\npeered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\\nTit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\\na moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\\n\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\nknow;\u2014square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\\nlook about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\\ncalms of all four oceans, her old hull\u2019s complexion was darkened like a\\nFrench grenadier\u2019s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts\u2014cut somewhere on the coast of\\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale\u2014her masts\\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\\ncommanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,\u2014this old Peleg, during the term\\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\\ninlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\u2019s carved buckler or\\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\\nbones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\\nsperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\\nand tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\\nwheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\\nwas in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\\nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\\nits jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\\nare touched with that.\\n\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\\nfirst I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\\nthe apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\\nto and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem\u2019s head. A\\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\\ninsider commanded a complete view forward.\\n\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\\nhis aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\\nship\u2019s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\nconstructed.\\n\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\\nwindward;\u2014for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\\ntogether.

The prospect was unlimited, but\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\\ncould see.\\n\\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s the report?\u201d said Peleg when I came back; \u201cwhat did ye\\nsee?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cNot much,\u201d I replied\u2014\u201cnothing but water; considerable horizon though,\\nand there\u2019s a squall coming up, I think.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWell, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can\u2019t ye see the world where\\nyou stand?\u201d\\n\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\\nPequod was as good a ship as any\u2014I thought the best\u2014and all this I now\\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\\nwillingness to ship me.\\n\\n\u201cAnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\u201d he added\u2014\u201ccome\\nalong with ye.\u201d And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\\ncabin.\\n\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\\nstocks bringing in good interest.\\n\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\\n\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\\nScripture names\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\u2014and in\\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature\u2019s sweet or\\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language\u2014that man makes\\none in a whole nation\u2019s census\u2014a mighty pageant creature, formed for\\nnoble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\\nsure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\\nand still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.","parsed":{"summary":"The protagonist meets with Captain Peleg and Bildad, who own and operate the whaling ship the Pequod, and has a humorous conversation about his previous occupation, motivation for joining a whaling ship, and the peculiarities of the Quaker community on Nantucket.","excerpt_1":"\\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg\u2014that\u2019s who ye are speaking to, young man.

Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\\nconclusion that a man\u2019s religion is one thing, and this practical world\\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\\n\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\\nsomething\u2014a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\n\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\\nreading from a ponderous volume.\\n\\n\u201cBildad,\u201d cried Captain Peleg, \u201cat it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\u201d\\n\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\n\\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s our man, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg, \u201che wants to ship.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDost thee?\u201d said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\n\\n\u201cI _dost_,\u201d said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\n\\n\u201cWhat do ye think of him, Bildad?\u201d said Peleg.\\n\\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\n\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\\nand drawing forth the ship\u2019s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\\nship\u2019s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\\nlay\u2014that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\\nwhatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\\nif we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\\nwould wear out on it, not to speak of my three years\u2019 beef and board,\\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.\\n\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\nfortune\u2014and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\\nbroad-shouldered make.\\n\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\\nwhole management of the ship\u2019s affairs to these two. And I did not know\\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \u201c_Lay_ not up for\\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\u2014\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWell, Captain Bildad,\u201d interrupted Peleg, \u201cwhat d\u2019ye say, what lay\\nshall we give this young man?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThou knowest best,\u201d was the sepulchral reply, \u201cthe seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh wouldn\u2019t be too much, would it?\u2014\u2018where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt, but _lay_\u2014\u2019\u201d\\n\\n_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\\n_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\\n\\n\u201cWhy, blast your eyes, Bildad,\u201d cried Peleg, \u201cthou dost not want to\\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSeven hundred and seventy-seventh,\u201d again said Bildad, without lifting\\nhis eyes; and then went on mumbling\u2014\u201cfor where your treasure is, there\\nwill your heart be also.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\u201d said Peleg, \u201cdo\\nye hear that, Bildad!

You\u2019ll starve; you\u2019ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\u201d But\\nnot a word did he reply.\\n\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\\nthought of Queequeg\u2014not four feet off\u2014sitting there in that uneasy\\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\\n\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\\n\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\u2019s religion,\\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\\nother person, because that other person don\u2019t believe it also. But when\\na man\u2019s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\\nto him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\\nlodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\\nargue the point with him.\\n\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. \u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201cget into bed\\nnow, and lie and listen to me.\u201d I then went on, beginning with the rise\\nand progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\\nreligions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\\nin cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\\nuseless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\\nand common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\\npained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\\nnecessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\\n\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o\u2019clock in the\\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\\n\\n\u201cNo more, Queequeg,\u201d said I, shuddering; \u201cthat will do;\u201d for I knew the\\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\\nhad visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\\nwhen a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\\nplaced in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\\nwere sent round with the victor\u2019s compliments to all his friends, just\\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\\n\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\\nreligion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\\npiety.\\n\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\\nmake much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\\nPequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator insists that Queequeg end his Ramadan, but Queequeg remains stubbornly still, and the narrator drapes a bearskin over him to keep him warm.

He\u2019s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be\\nall right again before long.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAll right again before long!\u201d laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\\nderisive sort of laugh. \u201cLook ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then\\nthis left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell much of anything about him; only I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s\\na good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s true\u2014yes, both true enough. But you must jump when\\nhe gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go\u2014that\u2019s the word with\\nCaptain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off\\nCape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;\\nnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar\\nin Santa?\u2014heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\\ncalabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last\\nvoyage, according to the prophecy. Didn\u2019t ye hear a word about them\\nmatters and something more, eh? No, I don\u2019t think ye did; how could ye?\\nWho knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows\u2019ever, mayhap, ye\u2019ve\\nheard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of\\nthat, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a\u2019most\u2014I mean they\\nknow he\u2019s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said I, \u201cwhat all this gibberish of yours is about, I\\ndon\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t much care; for it seems to me that you must be\\na little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,\\nof that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all\\nabout the loss of his leg.\u201d\\n\\n\u201c_All_ about it, eh\u2014sure you do?\u2014all?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cPretty sure.\u201d\\n\\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\\nstranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\\nlittle, turned and said:\u2014\u201cYe\u2019ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the\\npapers? Well, well, what\u2019s signed, is signed; and what\u2019s to be, will\\nbe; and then again, perhaps it won\u2019t be, after all.

Morning to ye,\\nshipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I\u2019m sorry I stopped\\nye.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cLook here, friend,\u201d said I, \u201cif you have anything important to tell\\nus, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are\\nmistaken in your game; that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;\\nyou are just the man for him\u2014the likes of ye.

Oh! when ye get there, tell \u2019em I\u2019ve concluded not to make one\\nof \u2019em.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAh, my dear fellow, you can\u2019t fool us that way\u2014you can\u2019t fool us. It\\nis the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a\\ngreat secret in him.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMorning to ye, shipmates, morning.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMorning it is,\u201d said I. \u201cCome along, Queequeg, let\u2019s leave this crazy\\nman.

But we had not gone\\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\\nthough at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,\\nbut with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\\nand half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship\\nthe day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the\\nvoyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\\nthings.\\n\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really\\ndogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,\\nand on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,\\nwithout seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and\\nfinally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.","parsed":{"summary":"A ragged stranger questions Ishmael and Queequeg about whether they have shipped on the Pequod and speaks in an ambiguous and half-revealing way about Captain Ahab and various shadowy things connected with the ship.","excerpt_1":"\\"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\\" [...] \\"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\\" said I, [...].","excerpt_2":"\\"Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\\" [...] \\"What do you know about him?\\"","text_to_image":"A ragged stranger with a confluent small-pox face points at the Pequod with his massive finger and asks \'Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\'.

All Astir.\\n\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\\nboard, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\\nbetokened that the ship\u2019s preparations were hurrying to a close.\\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\\nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing\\nand providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on\\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.\\n\\nOn the day following Queequeg\u2019s signing the articles, word was given at\\nall the inns where the ship\u2019s company were stopping, that their chests\\nmust be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\\nvessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\\nresolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\\nalways give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\\nfor several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod\\nwas fully equipped.\\n\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things\u2014beds, sauce-pans, knives and\\nforks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\\nwhich necessitates a three-years\u2019 housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far\\nfrom all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\\nthe whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\\nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\\nharbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare\\nspars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but\\na spare Captain and duplicate ship.\\n\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\\nPequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\\nfuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\\nends of things, both large and small.\\n\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\\nBildad\u2019s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable\\nspirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_\\ncould help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after\\nonce fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a\\njar of pickles for the steward\u2019s pantry; another time with a bunch of\\nquills for the chief mate\u2019s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some one\u2019s rheumatic back.\\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity\u2014Aunt\\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\\nBildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\\nwell-saved dollars.\\n\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\\n\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\\nhad been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\\nin my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\\nsea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\\nbe already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\\nhis suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.\\n\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\\nstart.","parsed":{"summary":"The Pequod is getting ready to set sail and the crew is busy with preparations and stocking up on supplies.

The cabin entrance was locked within; the\\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\\nslept upon him.\\n\\n\u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\u201d said I,\\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\\nmatter, were it not for Elijah\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper\u2019s rear,\\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\\nsat quietly down there.\\n\\n\u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\u2019t sit there,\u201d said I.\\n\\n\u201cOh! perry dood seat,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cmy country way; won\u2019t hurt him\\nface.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cFace!\u201d said I, \u201ccall that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\\nbut how hard he breathes, he\u2019s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\\nare heavy, it\u2019s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\\nhe\u2019ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don\u2019t wake.\u201d\\n\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\\n\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\u2019s head.\\n\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for, Queequeg?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cPerry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\u201d\\n\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\\nrubbed his eyes.\\n\\n\u201cHolloa!\u201d he breathed at last, \u201cwho be ye smokers?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cShipped men,\u201d answered I, \u201cwhen does she sail?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?

Starbuck\u2019s astir,\u201d said the rigger. \u201cHe\u2019s a lively chief mate,\\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\u201d And so\\nsaying he went on deck, and we followed.\\n\\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\\nlast things on board.

Merry Christmas.\\n\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\u2019s\\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\\nher last gift\u2014a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward\u2014after all this, the\\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\\nthe chief mate, Peleg said:\\n\\n\u201cNow, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\\nall ready\u2014just spoke to him\u2014nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster \u2019em aft here\u2014blast \u2019em!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cNo need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\u201d said\\nBildad, \u201cbut away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\u201d\\n\\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot\u2019s; and as he\\nwas not yet completely recovered\u2014so they said\u2014therefore, Captain Ahab\\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\\n\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\\nPeleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\\ncommanding, and not Bildad.\\n\\n\u201cAft here, ye sons of bachelors,\u201d he cried, as the sailors lingered at\\nthe main-mast. \u201cMr. Starbuck, drive \u2019em aft.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cStrike the tent there!\u201d\u2014was the next order. As I hinted before, this\\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\\nPequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\n\\n\u201cMan the capstan! Blood and thunder!\u2014jump!\u201d\u2014was the next command, and\\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes.\\n\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\\nis the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\\nit known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\\npilots of the port\u2014he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\\nin order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\\nconcerned in, for he never piloted any other craft\u2014Bildad, I say, might\\nnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\\napproaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\\nof psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\\nsort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\\nwill. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\\ncopy of Watts in each seaman\u2019s berth.\\n\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\\nand seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\\nand turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\\nfirst kick.\\n\\n\u201cIs that the way they heave in the marchant service?\u201d he roared.\\n\u201cSpring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don\u2019t ye\\nspring, I say, all of ye\u2014spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\\nwhiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\u201d And so saying, he moved\\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\\n\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\\nthe bows.\\n\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\\nfrost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\\nsteady notes were heard,\u2014\\n\\n\\n_\u201cSweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living\\ngreen.

The Advocate.\\n\\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;\\nand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among\\nlandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I\\nam all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby\\ndone to us hunters of whales.\\n\\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a\\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale\\nFishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed\\npre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\\n\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a\\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we\\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is\\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And\\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye\\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But\\neven granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable\\ncarrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to\\ndrink in all ladies\u2019 plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much\\nenhances the popular conceit of the soldier\u2019s profession; let me assure\\nye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would\\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale\u2019s vast tail,\\nfanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the\\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and\\nwonders of God!\\n\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\\nround the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\\n\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\n\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\u2019s time have admirals of their whaling\\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\\nout whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\\nscore or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\\nBritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\\nupwards of \xa31,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of\\nAmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;\\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen\\nthousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,\\nat the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if\\nthere be not something puissant in whaling?\\n\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\n\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,\\npoint out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty\\nyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken\\nin one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way\\nand another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\\ncontinuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may\\nwell be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\\npregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to\\ncatalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past\\nthe whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and\\nleast known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes\\nwhich had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage\\nharbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the\\nwhale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted\\nbetween them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the\\nheroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I\\nsay that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,\\nthat were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.\\nFor in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish\\nsharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,\\nbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines\\nand muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a\\nflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the\\nlife-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures\\nwhich Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted\\nunworthy of being set down in the ship\u2019s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,\\nthe world!\\n\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe\\nand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific\\ncoast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy\\nof the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,\\nit might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated\\nthe liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,\\nand the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.\\n\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was\\ngiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first\\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned\\nthose shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched\\nthere. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\\nMoreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent\\nbiscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.\\nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do\\ncommercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the\\nmissionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive\\nmissionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,\\nJapan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom\\nthe credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.\\n\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\\n\xe6sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to\\nshiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet\\nevery time.\\n\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you\\nwill say.\\n\\n_The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who\\nwrote the first account of our Leviathan?

Knights and Squires.\\n\\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\\nQuaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\\nicy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\\nhard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\\nwould not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\\nof general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\\nand cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\\nmerely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\\nwarranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\\nhad calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\\nchapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. \u201cI\\nwill have no man in my boat,\u201d said Starbuck, \u201cwho is not afraid of a\\nwhale.\u201d By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\\nencountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\\ndangerous comrade than a coward.\\n\\n\u201cAye, aye,\u201d said Stubb, the second mate, \u201cStarbuck, there, is as\\ncareful a man as you\u2019ll find anywhere in this fishery.\u201d But we shall\\nere long see what that word \u201ccareful\u201d precisely means when used by a\\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\\n\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\\nall mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\\nin fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\\ntheirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\\nWhat doom was his own father\u2019s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?\\n\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\\nand mighty man.\\n\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\\nabasement of poor Starbuck\u2019s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\\nthe fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\\nstock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\\nmen may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\\nand so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\\ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\\nfar within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\\nseem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But\\nthis august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,\\nbut that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.

Knights and Squires.\\n\\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\\nneither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\\nindifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\\nchase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\\nfor the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\\nwhale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\\ncrew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\\nthe snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very\\ndeath-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\\noff-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his\\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\\nnot sooner.\\n\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\\nthing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\\nhe turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\\nreadiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\\n\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\\ntime of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\\ntribulations, Stubb\u2019s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\\ndisinfecting agent.\\n\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. A\\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\\nhonor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\\nthree years\u2019 voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\\nthat length of time. As a carpenter\u2019s nails are divided into wrought\\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\\nArctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\\nof those battering seas.\\n\\nNow these three mates\u2014Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\\nPequod\u2019s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\\narmed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\\nof lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\\n\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\\nKnight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\\nformer one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\\nmoreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\\nand friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\\ndown who the Pequod\u2019s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\\nthem belonged.\\n\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected\\nfor his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\\n\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\\npromontory of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\\nneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\\nharpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\\nGay-Headers. Tashtego\u2019s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\\nand black rounding eyes\u2014for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\\nAntarctic in their glittering expression\u2014all this sufficiently\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\\nhalf-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\\nof the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate\u2019s squire.","parsed":{"summary":"This passage introduces the second and third mates of the Pequod, Stubb and Flask respectively, and describes their personalities and roles in the whale hunt.

Ahab.\\n\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\\nseen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\\nwatches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\\nto be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\\nthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\\nplain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\\ndictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\\npenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\\n\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\\ndisquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\\nsea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\\ntimes by the ragged Elijah\u2019s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\\nuneasiness\u2014to call it so\u2014which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this\u2014and rightly ascribed it\u2014to the\\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\\nin which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\\nand melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\\nthe forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\\ntaffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\\n\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\\nrecovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\\nunalterable mould, like Cellini\u2019s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\\nsaw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\\ngreat tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\\ntop to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\\ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\\ncertainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\\nno allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\\nTashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\\nAhab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\\nof Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\\nthe old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\\nthis old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might hardly come to\\npass, so he muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the\\ndead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\n\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\\nlivid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\\nnoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\\nbarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\\nbone of the sperm whale\u2019s jaw. \u201cAye, he was dismasted off Japan,\u201d said\\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; \u201cbut like his dismasted craft, he shipped\\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of \u2019em.\u201d\\n\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\\nthe Pequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\\nbeyond the ship\u2019s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\\nmighty woe.\\n\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\\n\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.","parsed":{"summary":"After several days at sea, Captain Ahab is finally seen standing on the quarter-deck with a baric white leg supporting him in an auger hole, and a livid brand streaked across his tawny scorched face.

Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\\n\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\\nup\u2014flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\\nsuns! For sleeping man, \u2019twas hard to choose between such winsome days\\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\\nand more they wrought on Ahab\u2019s texture.\\n\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. \u201cIt feels\\nlike going down into one\u2019s tomb,\u201d\u2014he would mutter to himself\u2014\u201cfor an\\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\\ngrave-dug berth.\u201d\\n\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\\nAhab then.\\n\\n\u201cAm I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\u201d said Ahab, \u201cthat thou wouldst wad me that\\nfashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\\nlast.\u2014Down, dog, and kennel!\u201d\\n\\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\\n\u201cI am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\\nlike it, sir.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAvast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,\\nas if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\n\\n\u201cNo, sir; not yet,\u201d said Stubb, emboldened, \u201cI will not tamely be\\ncalled a dog, sir.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThen be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,\\nor I\u2019ll clear the world of thee!\u201d\\n\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors\\nin his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\n\\n\u201cI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\u201d\\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. \u201cIt\u2019s\\nvery queer.

But what was still more curious, Flask\u2014you know how\\ncurious all dreams are\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. \u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row?

While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\\nshoulders, and slews me round. \u2018What are you \u2019bout?\u2019 says he.

Nevertheless, though of real\\nknowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in\\nsome small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are\\nthe men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at\\nlarge or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:\u2014The Authors\\nof the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;\\nRay; Linn\xe6us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\\nMarten; Lac\xe9p\xe8de; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick\\nCuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;\\nthe Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to\\nwhat ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above\\ncited extracts will show.\\n\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\\nmentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\\nupon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of\\nthe whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\\nprofound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\\nand whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\\ndays, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was\\nto them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a\\nnew proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,\u2014the\\nGreenland whale is deposed,\u2014the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\n\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\\ndegree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s;\\nboth in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both\\nexact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to\\nbe found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\\nit is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\\ndescription. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\\nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\\nwhales, his is an unwritten life.\\n\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\\nreason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\\ndescription of the various species, or\u2014in this place at least\u2014to much\\nof any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of\\na systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\\n\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\\nafter them; to have one\u2019s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\\nare some preliminaries to settle.\\n\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\\nNature, A.D. 1776, Linn\xe6us declares, \u201cI hereby separate the whales from\\nthe fish.\u201d But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\\nsharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linn\xe6us\u2019s express edict,\\nwere still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\\nLeviathan.\\n\\nThe grounds upon which Linn\xe6us would fain have banished the whales from\\nthe waters, he states as follows: \u201cOn account of their warm bilocular\\nheart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\\nintrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\u201d and finally, \u201cex lege natur\xe6 jure\\nmeritoque.\u201d I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\\nCoffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\\nthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\\ninsufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\\n\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linn\xe6us has given\\nyou those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\\n\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\\nposition.\\n\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\\nwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\\nhand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\\nalien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\\nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the\\ngrand divisions of the entire whale host.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator introduces the science of Cetology and the difficulties inherent in classifying whales.

But as these pig-fish\\nare a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\\nand feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\\ntheir credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\\npassports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\\n\\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\\nall, both small and large.\\n\\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\\n\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO,\\nthe _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_.\\n\\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:\u2014I. The\\n_Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV.\\nthe _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur\\nBottom Whale_.\\n\\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).\u2014This whale, among the\\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\\nspermaceti was really derived.\\n\\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).\u2014In one respect this is\\nthe most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\\nhunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\\nbaleen; and the oil specially known as \u201cwhale oil,\u201d an inferior article\\nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor\u2019 West Coast, and various other parts of\\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\\n\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\\nEnglish and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree\\nin all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\\ndeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\\nendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\\nsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.\\nThe right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with\\nreference to elucidating the sperm whale.\\n\\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).\u2014Under this head I reckon\\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\u2019s names for a few sorts.\\n\\nIn connection with this appellative of \u201cWhalebone whales,\u201d it is of\\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis.

He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\\nvaluable. He has baleen.

(_Razor Back_).\u2014Of this whale little is\\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.

He is seldom seen;\\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\\n\\nThus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II.

(_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).\u2014Though this fish, whose\\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\\ngreat sperm whale.\\n\\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).\u2014I give the popular\\nfishermen\u2019s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\\nemployment\u2014as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\\n\\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\\nwhale_.\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale\u2014however that may be\u2014it would\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\\nsea-unicorn\u2019s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\\nThames; \u201cwhen Sir Martin returned from that voyage,\u201d saith Black\\nLetter, \u201con bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\\nat Windsor.\u201d An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.\\n\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\\nmilk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.\\nHis oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,\\nand he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\n\\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).\u2014Of this whale little is\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage\u2014a sort of\\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\\n\\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).\u2014This gentleman is famous\\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\\nmounts the Folio whale\u2019s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\\n\\n Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III.

He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.

The Specksnyder.\\n\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\n\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\u2019s vocation is evinced\\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\\nthose days, the captain\u2019s authority was restricted to the navigation\\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\u2019s more\\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\\nground) the command of the ship\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the grand\\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\\ntheir social equal.\\n\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\\nthis\u2014the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\\nthe captain\u2019s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\\nit.\\n\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\n\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\\nhe ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\\nquarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\\naddressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in\\nterrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\\n\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\\nirresistible dictatorship. For be a man\u2019s intellectual superiority what\\nit will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\\nother men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God\u2019s true princes of the Empire from\\nthe world\u2019s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\\ngive, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\\nNicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\\nimperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\\ntremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\\ndepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,\\never forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one\\nnow alluded to.\\n\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\\nand housings are denied me.

The Cabin-Table.\\n\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\\nloaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\\nand master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\\nan observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\\nthe smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\\nthe upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\\ntidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\\ndeck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \u201cDinner, Mr.\\nStarbuck,\u201d disappears into the cabin.\\n\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck,\\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\\nand, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\\npleasantness, \u201cDinner, Mr. Stubb,\u201d and descends the scuttle. The second\\nEmir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\\nmain brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \u201cDinner,\\nMr. Flask,\u201d follows after his predecessors.\\n\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\\nover the Grand Turk\u2019s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\u2019s presence,\\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\\n\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\\nsame commander\u2019s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that man\u2019s unchallenged power\\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that man\u2019s royalty\\nof state transcends Belshazzar\u2019s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be C\xe6sar.\\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\\nship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\\n\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\\non the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man\u2019s knife, as he carved\\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\\nthereby motioned Starbuck\u2019s plate towards him, the mate received his\\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\\nit was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\\nof this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\\nhis would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\\nfirst degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\\nwas a butterless man!\\n\\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\u2019s dinner was badly\\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\\nday; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\\ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\\nFor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\\nfrom my stomach.

While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\\nDough-Boy\u2019s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\\nDough-Boy\u2019s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\\nover.\\n\\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\\nhis filed teeth to the Indian\u2019s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\\nlow carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\\nbroad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating\u2014an ugly sound enough\u2014so\\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\\nbe picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\\nhanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\\ntheir lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\\nthat in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler.

He\\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\\nof the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\\nwinter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\\nage, Ahab\u2019s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom!","parsed":{"summary":"The harpooneers on the ship Moby Dick have a care-free, almost frenzied culture of dining, in contrast to the captain and mates.

The Mast-Head.\\n\\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\\nother seamen my first mast-head came round.\\n\\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\\nsimultaneously with the vessel\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may\\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years\u2019 voyage she\\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in her\u2014say, an empty vial\\neven\u2014then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\\nskysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\\n\\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\\ndread gale of God\u2019s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\\nbelief among arch\xe6ologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules\u2019 pillars, his column marks that\\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\\nshunned.\\n\\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\\nso, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\\nyou shall have for dinner\u2014for all your meals for three years and more\\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\\n\\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\u2019\\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t\u2019 gallant-mast, where you\\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\\ncalled the t\u2019 gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull\u2019s horns. To\\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\\nyour watch-coat.","parsed":{"summary":"The passage discusses the practice of standing mast-heads on a whale-ship, which involves sailors rotating standing watch at a high point on the mast for several hours at a time.

In\\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \u201cA Voyage among the\\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\u201d in this\\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\\n_crow\u2019s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\u2019s\\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest_, in honor of\\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest is something\\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\\nmast-head in this crow\u2019s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crow\u2019s-nest; but though he\\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow\u2019s-nest, with a small\\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\\nresulting from what is called the \u201clocal attraction\u201d of all binnacle\\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\\nthe ship\u2019s planks, and in the Glacier\u2019s case, perhaps, to there having\\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\\nlearned \u201cbinnacle deviations,\u201d \u201cazimuth compass observations,\u201d and\\n\u201capproximate errors,\u201d he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow\u2019s nest, within\\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\\naloft there in that bird\u2019s nest within three or four perches of the\\npole.\\n\\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.\\n\\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\\nbut sorry guard.

Nor\\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\\nsentiment in tar and blubber.

In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\\nebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\\nlike Cranmer\u2019s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\\nevery shore the round globe over.\\n\\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\\nthe inscrutable tides of God.

There most sea-captains usually walk at that\\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\\nthe garden.\\n\\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk.

Moby Dick.\\n\\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;\\nmy oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more\\ndid I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A\\nwild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab\u2019s quenchless feud\\nseemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous\\nmonster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of\\nviolence and revenge.\\n\\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\\nconcerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\\nthan Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\\nregarded.\\n\\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\\nin these assaults\u2014not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\\nlimbs, or devouring amputations\u2014but fatal to the last degree of\\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\\nWhale had eventually come.\\n\\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\\nterrible events,\u2014as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\\na mighty birth.\\n\\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\\nhalf-formed f\u0153tal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\\njaw.\\n\\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\\nperhaps\u2014either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\\nwhich stem him.\\n\\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\\nnaturalists\u2014Olassen and Povelson\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier\u2019s, were these or almost\\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\\nincluded) are \u201cstruck with the most lively terrors,\u201d and \u201coften in the\\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death.\u201d And however the general\\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\\n\\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.\\n\\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\\noffered.\\n\\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\\ninstant of time.","parsed":{"summary":"Ishmael recounts how the legend of Moby Dick grew among the whaling fleet, consuming all sorts of rumors and ideas about the creature until even experienced whalers saw him as a supernatural being.

For as\\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\\npoints.\\n\\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor\u2019 West Passage, so long a\\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\\n\\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\\njet would once more be seen.\\n\\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out\u2014a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\\n\\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\\ngleamings.\\n\\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\\nMore than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\\nperhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\\n\\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale\u2019s\\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\\nunintelligent agent.\\n\\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\\nwhite curds of the whale\u2019s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\\n\\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\\neddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\\ndashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\\nwhale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\\nhis sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away\\nAhab\u2019s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\\nno hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\\nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\\nagainst the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\\nhe at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\\nwhich has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\\nChristians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\\nthe east reverenced in their statue devil;\u2014Ahab did not fall down and\\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.

Then, in darting at the\\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun\u2019sails\\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\\nthe old man\u2019s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\\nstill subtler form. Ahab\u2019s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\u2019s broad madness had been\\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\\nreasonable object.\\n\\nThis is much; yet Ahab\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\\nwe here stand\u2014however grand and wonderful, now quit it;\u2014and take your\\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man\u2019s upper earth, his root\\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\\nState-secret come.\\n\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.\\n\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.

But be all this as it may, certain it is,\\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.

The Whiteness of the Whale.\\n\\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\\nwas to me, as yet remains unsaid.\\n\\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\\ncould not but occasionally awaken in any man\u2019s soul some alarm, there\\nwas another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,\\nwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;\\nand yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost\\ndespair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of\\nthe whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to\\nexplain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I\\nmust, else all these chapters might be naught.\\n\\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,\\nas if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\\njaponicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,\\ngrand old kings of Pegu placing the title \u201cLord of the White Elephants\u201d\\nabove all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the\\nmodern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the\\nroyal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a\\nsnow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, C\xe6sarian, heir to\\noverlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;\\nand though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,\\ngiving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and\\nthough, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of\\ngladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and\\nthough in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is\\nmade the emblem of many touching, noble things\u2014the innocence of brides,\\nthe benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of\\nthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in\\nmany climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of\\nthe Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn\\nby milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\\nand power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame\\nbeing held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,\\nGreat Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and\\nthough to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred\\nWhite Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that\\nspotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send\\nto the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and\\nthough directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests\\nderive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\\nworn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\\nfaith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\\nour Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to\\nthe redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white\\nbefore the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there\\nwhite like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with\\nwhatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\\nelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more\\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\\n\\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\\nterrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\\nWitness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the\\ntropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\\ntranscendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\\nto the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded\\nbear or shark.*\\n\\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\\nwould fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\\nit might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\\nyet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\\nterror.\\n\\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\\nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\\nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\\nmass for the dead begins with \u201cRequiem eternam\u201d (eternal rest), whence\\n_Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.\\nNow, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,\\nand the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.\\n\\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\\nwonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\\nimaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God\u2019s great,\\nunflattering laureate, Nature.*\\n\\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\\ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\\nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\\nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\\nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its\\nvast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\\nflutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\\ncries, as some king\u2019s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\\nlearned that goney was some seaman\u2019s name for albatross. So that by no\\npossibility could Coleridge\u2019s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\\nour deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\\nbe an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\\n\\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\\nemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\\n\\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will\\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.\\nAt last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern\\ntally round its neck, with the ship\u2019s time and place; and then letting\\nit escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was\\ntaken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,\\nthe invoking, and adoring cherubim!","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator reflects on his own terror of the whiteness of Moby Dick, while acknowledging the cultural significance of the color white.

He was the\\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\\nmane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\\nworld, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\\nglories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\\nbluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\\nstreamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\\nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\\nhis cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\\nthe bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.\\nNor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\\nnoble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so\\nclothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it\\nwhich, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\\nnameless terror.\\n\\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\\nAlbatross.\\n\\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\\nthe eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is\\nthat whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\\nbears. The Albino is as well made as other men\u2014has no substantive\\ndeformity\u2014and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him\\nmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\\nso?\\n\\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not\\nthe less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\\ncrowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\\nSquall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\\nthat passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\\nmarket-place!\\n\\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\\nshroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail\\nto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\\na milk-white fog\u2014Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\\neven the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\\nhis pallid horse.\\n\\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\\nthing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\\n\\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\\naccount for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by\\nthe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\\nwhiteness\u2014though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\\nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,\\nbut nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however\\nmodified;\u2014can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us\\nto the hidden cause we seek?\\n\\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\\nthough, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\\nto be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\\nentirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able\\nto recall them now.\\n\\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare\\nmention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,\\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded\\nwith new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of\\nthe Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White\\nFriar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\\n\\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\\nkings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower\\nof London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an\\nuntravelled American, than those other storied structures, its\\nneighbors\u2014the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer\\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar\\nmoods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\\nmention of that name, while the thought of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge is\\nfull of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all\\nlatitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a\\nspectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with\\nmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,\\nfollowed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a\\nwholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in\\nreading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does \u201cthe tall pale man\u201d\\nof the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides\\nthrough the green of the groves\u2014why is this phantom more terrible than\\nall the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\\n\\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide\\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop\\n(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of\\nhouse-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;\u2014it\\nis not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,\\nsaddest city thou can\u2019st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and\\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,\\nthis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful\\ngreenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid\\npallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.\\n\\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness\\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\\nobjects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there\\naught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind\\nalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when\\nexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\\nuniversality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\\n\\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if\\nby night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels\\njust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\\nprecisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to\\nview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness\u2014as if\\nfrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming\\nround him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded\\nphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in\\nvain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm\\nthey both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.\\nYet where is the mariner who will tell thee, \u201cSir, it was not so much\\nthe fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous\\nwhiteness that so stirred me?\u201d\\n\\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\\nsnow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\\naltitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\\nlose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\\nbackwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\\nunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig\\nto break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding\\nthe scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal\\ntrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his\\nmisery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with\\nits lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.\\n\\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is\\nbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a\\nhypo, Ishmael.","parsed":{"summary":"The passage explores the concept of whiteness and its ability to elicit both reverence and fear in various contexts.","excerpt_1":"Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.","excerpt_2":"First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties...","text_to_image":"A ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness, surrounded by shoals of combed white bears."},"image":null},{"merge":"C042.03","passage":"Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of\\nVermont, far removed from all beasts of prey\u2014why is it that upon the\\nsunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that\\nhe cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness\u2014why\\nwill he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in\\nphrensies of affright?

The Chart.\\n\\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\\ntook place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\\npurpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\\ntransom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\\ncharts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating\\nhimself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various\\nlines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady\\npencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At\\nintervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein\\nwere set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\\n\\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\\nhead, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever\\nthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till\\nit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\\ncourses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing\\nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\\n\\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\\nothers were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\\n\\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem\\nto Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whale\u2019s food; and, also, calling\\nto mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\\nlatitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to\\ncertainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\\nground in search of his prey.\\n\\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\\nsperm whale\u2019s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\\n\\n\\n  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\\n  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\\n  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\\n  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\\n  portions of it are presented in the circular. \u201cThis chart divides the\\n  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\\n  longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\\n  columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\\n  districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\\n  been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\\n  show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\\n  seen.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\\nsperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct\u2014say, rather, secret\\nintelligence from the Deity\u2014mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;\\ncontinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one\\ntithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor\u2019s parallel,\\nand though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\\nunavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\\ntimes he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship\u2019s mast-heads, when\\ncircumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.\\n\\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\\nwholly without prospect of a meeting.\\n\\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\\nfound there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\\nthough Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\\nis called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\\nthe Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\\nwould infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\\ngrounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed\\nonly his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\\nplaces of prolonged abode. And where Ahab\u2019s chances of accomplishing\\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\\nwhatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase\u2014the\\nSeason-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\\nMoby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\\nhunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\\ncrowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\\nhopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\\n\\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\\ncommander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\\nPacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next\\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod\u2019s sailing had,\\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\\ncomplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\\nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\\noff the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\\nother waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\\nNor\u2019-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\\nmight blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\\nPequod\u2019s circumnavigating wake.","parsed":{"summary":"Captain Ahab studies sea charts to navigate the ocean currents and eddies in search of the elusive Moby Dick.","excerpt_1":"Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.","excerpt_2":"But not so in the reality, perhaps.

Yes. For the peculiar\\nsnow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\\nunmistakable.

Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\\nof some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\\nplainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\\nscheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\\nburst from it in horror again.

The Affidavit.\\n\\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,\\nas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\\nparticulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in\\nits earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this\\nvolume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\\nmore familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\\nand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of\\nthe entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity\\nof the main points of this affair.\\n\\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be\\ncontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\\nitems, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from\\nthese citations, I take it\u2014the conclusion aimed at will naturally\\nfollow of itself.\\n\\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\\nsame hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\\nthink it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\\ninto the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\\noften endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\\nunknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\\non its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\\nother. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\\nthat is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\\nattack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\\nafterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\\nlast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\\nwhale\u2019s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\\nthree years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three\\ninstances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard\\nof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\\nis no good ground to impeach.\\n\\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\\nthe world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\\nin that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\\npeculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\\nvaluable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump\\nfor their presumption.\\n\\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\ncelebrity\u2014Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\\nbut he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions\\nof a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or C\xe6sar. Was it not\\nso, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so\\nlong did\u2019st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was\\noft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand\\nJack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the\\nvicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,\\nwhose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white\\ncross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,\\nmarked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In\\nplain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of\\nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.\\n\\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\\nfinally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed\\nby valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that\\nexpress object as much in view, as in setting out through the\\nNarragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture\\nthat notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the\\nIndian King Philip.\\n\\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\\nas much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\\nhints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\\nfishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\\nworse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\n\\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\\nperils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\\nconception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\\nOne reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters\\nand deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at\\nhome, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you\\nsuppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by\\nthe whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to\\nthe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan\u2014do you suppose that\\nthat poor fellow\u2019s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\\nread to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very\\nirregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what\\nmight be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I\\ntell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,\\namong many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which\\nhad had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that\\nhad each lost a boat\u2019s crew. For God\u2019s sake, be economical with your\\nlamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of\\nman\u2019s blood was spilled for it.\\n\\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\\nis an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that\\nwhen narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold\\nenormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\\nfacetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\\nbeing facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of\\nEgypt.\\n\\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\\ntestimony entirely independent of my own.

He came directly from the shoal which we had just\\nbefore entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings.\u201d Again: \u201cAt all events, the\\nwhole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,\\nand producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\\ncalculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\\nimpressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\\ncorrect in my opinion.\u201d\\n\\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\\nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\\nhospitable shore. \u201cThe dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the\\nfears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon\\nhidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\\ncontemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment\u2019s thought; the\\ndismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,\\nwholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.\u201d\\n\\nIn another place\u2014p. 45,\u2014he speaks of \u201c_the mysterious and mortal attack\\nof the animal_.\u201d\\n\\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\\ntotally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\\nparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\\nthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\\nallusions to it.\\n\\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J\u2014\u2014, then\\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\\ndining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in\\nthe harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\\nthe Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\\ndenied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout\\nsloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\\ngood; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set\\nsail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on\\nthe way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments\u2019\\nconfidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\\nCommodore\u2019s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not\\nsuperstitious, but I consider the Commodore\u2019s interview with that whale\\nas providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\\nsimilar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\\n\\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff\u2019s Voyages for a little circumstance\\nin point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\\nmust know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern\u2019s\\nfamous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.\\nCaptain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\\n\\n\u201cBy the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\\nwe were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was\\nvery clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\\nkeep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was\\nnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.\\nAn uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship\\nitself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived\\nby any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full\\nsail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,\\nas this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three\\nfeet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell\\naltogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,\\nconcluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw\\nthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain\\nD\u2019Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\\nvessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very\\nhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured.\u201d\\n\\nNow, the Captain D\u2019Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\\nDorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I\\nhave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.\\nHe substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large\\none: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\\n\\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\\ntoo, of honest wonders\u2014the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\\nDampier\u2019s old chums\u2014I found a little matter set down so like that just\\nquoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\\ncorroborative example, if such be needed.\\n\\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to \u201cJohn Ferdinando,\u201d as he calls the\\nmodern Juan Fernandes. \u201cIn our way thither,\u201d he says, \u201cabout four\\no\u2019clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\\nthey were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.\\nAnd, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for\\ngranted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was\\na little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *\\n* * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\\ncarriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.\\nCaptain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his\\ncabin!\u201d Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and\\nseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\\nearthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief\\nalong the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\\n\\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\\nthat these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon\u2014Verily there is\\nnothing new under the sun.","parsed":{"summary":"The chapter discusses the incredible power and malice of sperm whales, exemplified by several accounts of ships attacked and destroyed by them, including the loss of the Essex and the Union, and the attack on Commodore J\'s ship.

As many know, he wrote the history of his own\\ntimes, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he\\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\\nhistorian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\\nthe matter presently to be mentioned.\\n\\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\\nskeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\n\\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\\nsubstance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\\nwhale\u2014squid or cuttle-fish\u2014lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\\nfound at its surface.

Surmises.\\n\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman\u2019s ways, altogether\\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\\n\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced\\nwill were Ahab\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain;\\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\\nhis captain\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\ncaptain\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\\nbackground (for few men\u2019s courage is proof against protracted\\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\\nmore or less capricious and unreliable\u2014they live in the varying outer\\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness\u2014and when retained for any\\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\\nsuspended for the final dash.\\n\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\\nand romantic object\u2014that final and romantic object, too many would have\\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\\nall hopes of cash\u2014aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\\nsoon cashier Ahab.\\n\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\\nPequod\u2019s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\\nsubjected to.\\n\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\u2019s\\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\\npursuit of his profession.\\n\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.","parsed":{"summary":"Ahab is consumed with finding Moby Dick, but cannot abandon the collateral pursuit of the voyage and must consider his crew\'s needs and tendencies to ensure their loyalty and success.","excerpt_1":"To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.","excerpt_2":"Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally.","text_to_image":"A group of sailors, with Ahab at the center, gathered around a map with various tools and instruments spread out on the table before them, all looking intently at the map and discussing their pursuit of Moby Dick, while food and drink are brought around to sustain them."},"image":null},{"merge":"C047.01","passage":"\\n\\n 47. The Mat-Maker.\\n\\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\\nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\\nsomehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\\nlurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\\ninvisible self.\\n\\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\\ndid there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\\nbroken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\\nweaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\\nthe warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\\nvibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\\ninterblending of other threads with its own.

The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\\nultimate course\u2014its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\\nto that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\\nlast featuring blow at events.\\n\\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\\nfree will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\\nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\\nforward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\\nintervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\\nvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\\nwhalemen\u2019s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\\nlungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\\ncadence as from Tashtego the Indian\u2019s.\\n\\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\\nannouncing their coming.\\n\\n\u201cThere she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhere-away?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOn the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!\u201d\\n\\nInstantly all was commotion.\\n\\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\\nreliable uniformity.

But you must not suppose from this\\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\\nwith his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\\npeculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\\nbroadly gaped\u2014open-mouthed at times\u2014that the mere sight of such a\\nyawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\\nwhose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\\ninferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.\\n\\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\\nacross Stubb\u2019s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\\n\\n\u201cMr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\\nplease!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHalloa!\u201d returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\\nlike a flint from Stubb\u2019s.\\n\\n\u201cWhat think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSmuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed.

It took off the extreme edge\\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb\u2019s confident way of\\naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab\u2019s precise agency in\\nthe matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the\\nmysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the\\ndim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\\nunaccountable Elijah.\\n\\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\\nfencer\u2019s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\\nfixed, while the boat\u2019s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\\nand crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\\nthe rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\\ndown into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\\n\\n\u201cEvery man look out along his oars!\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cThou, Queequeg,\\nstand up!\u201d\\n\\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\\n\\nNot very far distant Flask\u2019s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\\nthe level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\\nwhale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man\u2019s hand,\\nand standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\\nwas full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\\n\\n\u201cI can\u2019t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\\nthat.\u201d\\n\\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,\\nswiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\\nshoulders for a pedestal.\\n\\n\u201cGood a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThat I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\\nfifty feet taller.\u201d\\n\\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\\nFlask\u2019s foot, and then putting Flask\u2019s hand on his hearse-plumed head\\nand bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\\nfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\\nFlask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\\nbreastband to lean against and steady himself by.\\n\\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\\nposture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\\nperverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\\ncurious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\\nFlask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\\nThough truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\\ngive to the negro\u2019s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity\\nstamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her\\ntides and her seasons for that.\\n\\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\\nsolicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, \u201cDown, down all, and give\\nway!\u2014there they are!\u201d\\n\\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\\nindications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.\\n\\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\\nwater and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as\\na mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\\nhills.\\n\\n\u201cPull, pull, my good boys,\u201d said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\\n\\nHow different the loud little King-Post. \u201cSing out and say something,\\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on\\ntheir black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I\u2019ll sign over to you\\nmy Martha\u2019s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,\\nboys.

Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\\n\\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.

In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\\nstandard-bearer of this forlorn hope.

Again we swam for it, were\\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\\nlanded on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.

So Tamerlane\u2019s soldiers often argued with tears in\\ntheir eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\\ninto the thickest of the fight.\\n\\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that\\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\\nman to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\\n\\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt\u2014above all for\\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat\u2019s\\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat\u2019s\\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\\nmatter. Until Cabaco\u2019s published discovery, the sailors had little\\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\\nis sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat\u2019s bow for bracing\\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\\nfixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\\ncarpenter\u2019s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\\ncuriosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\\nthe ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat\u2019s crew\\nbeing assigned to that boat.\\n\\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\\nexcitement in the forecastle.\\n\\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\\nmuffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\\nlinked with Ahab\u2019s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\\nauthority over him; all this none knew.

The Spirit-Spout.\\n\\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.\\n\\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\\nhundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\\nemotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\\nsuch unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\\nwhen, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\\nnights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\\nhad lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she\\nblows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\\na most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\\nlowering.\\n\\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\\nt\u2019gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\\ninfluences were struggling in her\u2014one to mount direct to heaven, the\\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\\nAhab\u2019s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\\nechoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\\ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\\nso swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\\nsailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\\n\\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\\ninto the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\\nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\\nalluring us on.\\n\\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\\none self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\\nand most savage seas.\\n\\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\\nwearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\\nerrand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.\\n\\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\\nthat are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\\nblast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\\nsilver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\\ndesolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\\ndismal than before.\\n\\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\\nbefore us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\\nthing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\\ntheir homeless selves.

The Gam.\\n\\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\\nnot been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\\nher\u2014judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions\u2014if so it had\\nbeen that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\\nto the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\\nto consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\\nall this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\\nhere of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\\nin foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\\n\\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\\nresting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\u2014off lone\\nFanning\u2019s Island, or the far away King\u2019s Mills; how much more natural,\\nI say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\\ntalk about.\\n\\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\\nboard; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\\nthumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\\nimportance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\\nwhaling vessels crossing each other\u2019s track on the cruising-ground\\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\\nfar remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\\nthe ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\\nand have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the\\nsympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\\nprivations and perils.\\n\\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\\nwith Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number\\nof English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when\\nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;\\nfor your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not\\nfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English\\nwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\\nAmerican whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his\\nnondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\\nsuperiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be\\nhard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill\\nmore whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this\\nis a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\\nNantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\\nthat he has a few foibles himself.\\n\\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable\u2014and they are so. Whereas, some\\nmerchant ships crossing each other\u2019s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies\\nin Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism\\nupon each other\u2019s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at\\nsea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\\nscrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be\\nmuch right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,\\nthey run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,\\nwhen they chance to cross each other\u2019s cross-bones, the first hail\\nis\u2014\u201cHow many skulls?\u201d\u2014the same way that whalers hail\u2014\u201cHow many\\nbarrels?\u201d And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\\napart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don\u2019t like to\\nsee overmuch of each other\u2019s villanous likenesses.\\n\\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \u201c_Gam_,\u201d a thing so\\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\\nand repeat gamesome stuff about \u201cspouters\u201d and \u201cblubber-boilers,\u201d and\\nsuch like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\\nalso all Pirates and Man-of-War\u2019s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\\nsuch a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\\nwould be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should\\nlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\\nabout it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at\\nthe gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,\\nhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude.

But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\\nof that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.

The Town-Ho\u2019s Story.\\n\\n(_As told at the Golden Inn._)\\n\\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\\nmuch like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet\\nmore travellers than in any other part.\\n\\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us\\nstrong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White\\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho\u2019s\\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may\\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never\\nreached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of\\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the\\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of\\nwhom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could\\nnot well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod\u2019s main-mast.\\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\\nproceed to put on lasting record.\\n\\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\\nstill used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\\n\\nFor my humor\u2019s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\\nsaint\u2019s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\\n\\n\u201cSome two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\u2019 sail eastward\\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\\nto daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\\nthan common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\\nthe captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\\nluck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\\nthough, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\\nher cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\\nthe leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\\nnow taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\\nrepaired.\\n\\n\u201cThough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\\nship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been\\nfor the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the\\nbitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\\nBuffalo.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Lakeman!\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\u2019\\nsaid Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\n\\n\u201cOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\u2014I crave your\\ncourtesy\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\\nSuperior, and Michigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\\nof the ocean\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\\nraces and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\\ndotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\\nhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\\nyield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\\nfrom out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\\nlines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild\\nAfric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give\\nrobes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\\nare, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\\nthough an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\\nnurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\\nbeach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\\nfollowed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\\nseaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet\\nwas this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this\\nLakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by\\ninflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human\\nrecognition which is the meanest slave\u2019s right; thus treated, this\\nSteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he\\nhad proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and\\nSteelkilt\u2014but, gentlemen, you shall hear.","parsed":{"summary":"The Town-Ho, a Polynesian-crewed whaleman, encountered the Pequod and shared news of Moby Dick.

You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\\nAtlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their\\nwhole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the\\nofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\\nremember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\\nNor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\\ngentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their\\npump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;\\nthat is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other\\nreasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is\\nin some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\\nlatitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\\n\\n\u201cMuch this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\\ngaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\\nseveral of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\\nupper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\\nexpanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\\ncoward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\\ntouching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or\\non sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he\\nbetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\\nseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner\\nin her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was\\non this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\\nwater; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen\u2014that bubbling from the\\npumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at\\nthe lee scupper-holes.\\n\\n\u201cNow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\\nworld of ours\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\\nover his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\\nsuperior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\\nconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\\nchance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern\u2019s tower, and make\\na little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\\ngentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\\nhead like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\\nhousings of your last viceroy\u2019s snorting charger; and a brain, and a\\nheart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\\nCharlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne\u2019s father. But Radney,\\nthe mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.\\nHe did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\\n\\n\u201cEspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with\\nhis gay banterings.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\u2019s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\\none of ye, and let\u2019s have a taste. By the Lord, it\u2019s worth bottling! I\\ntell ye what, men, old Rad\u2019s investment must go for it! he had best cut\\naway his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\\nsword-fish only began the job; he\u2019s come back again with a gang of\\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\\nposse of \u2019em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\\nmaking improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I\u2019d tell him\\nto jump overboard and scatter \u2019em. They\u2019re playing the devil with his\\nestate, I can tell him. But he\u2019s a simple old soul,\u2014Rad, and a beauty\\ntoo. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if he\u2019d give a poor devil like me the model\\nof his nose.\u2019\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Damn your eyes! what\u2019s that pump stopping for?\u2019 roared Radney,\\npretending not to have heard the sailors\u2019 talk. \u2018Thunder away at it!\u2019\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, sir,\u2019 said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \u2018Lively, boys,\\nlively, now!\u2019 And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\\nthe men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\\nof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life\u2019s\\nutmost energies.\\n\\n\u201cQuitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\\nforward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\\nfiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\\nbrow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\\npig to run at large.\\n\\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\u2019s deck at sea is a piece of household\\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\\nif boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\\nnautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\\nstood between the two men.\\n\\n\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\\nplainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\\nin his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate\u2019s\\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being\u2014a\\nrepugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\\naggrieved\u2014this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\\nSteelkilt.\\n\\n\u201cTherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\\ncustomary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\\nlittle or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\\nuplifted cooper\u2019s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\\nby.\\n\\n\u201cHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\\nhis bidding.\\n\\n\u201cSteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\\nhis intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\\nwas to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\\nwindlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:","parsed":{"summary":"The crew of the Town-Ho is concerned as the ship\'s leak seems to be increasing, and the mate Radney is particularly anxious about the safety of the ship.

There\u2019s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Is that a friar passing?\u2019 said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the\\ncrowded plazza, with humorous concern.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\u2019s Inquisition wanes in\\nLima,\u2019 laughed Don Sebastian. \u2018Proceed, Senor.\u2019\\n\\n\u201c\u2018A moment!

A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\\nunshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\\ngood turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\\nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\\nto back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\\nsum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\\nmany of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\\nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\\nline, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\\ntransition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018I see!

But sliding down\\nthe ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\\nuproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\\nOthers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\\nturmoil ensued; while standing out of harm\u2019s way, the valiant captain\\ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the\\nquarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of\\nthe confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to\\nprick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his\\ndesperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the\\nforecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks\\nin a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves\\nbehind the barricade.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\u2019 roared the captain, now menacing them\\nwith a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \u2018Come\\nout of that, ye cut-throats!\u2019\\n\\n\u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\u2019s) death would be the signal\\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\u2019 demanded their\\nringleader.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty! Do you want to\\nsink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!\u2019 and he\\nonce more raised a pistol.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Sink the ship?\u2019 cried Steelkilt. \u2018Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\\nturns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\\nsay ye, men?\u2019 turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\\nresponse.\\n\\n\u201cThe Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\u2014\u2018It\u2019s not our\\nfault; we didn\u2019t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\\nboy\u2019s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\\nprick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\\ncursed jaw; ain\u2019t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\\nmen? look to those handspikes, my hearties.

Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\\nsomething down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them\u2014ten\\nin number\u2014leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\\nremained neutral.\\n\\n\u201cAll night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\\nnight dismally resounded through the ship.\\n\\n\u201cAt sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was\\nthen lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\\ndays this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\\nand then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\\nready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\\nthem to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\\nbelonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\\nthem. Only three were left.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Better turn to, now?\u2019 said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Shut us up again, will ye!\u2019 cried Steelkilt.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Oh certainly,\u2019 said the Captain, and the key clicked.\\n\\n\u201cIt was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\\nblack as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\\nthe two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\\ntheir keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\\nhandle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\\nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\\nhimself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\\nThat was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\\nready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\\nsurrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\\nman on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\\ntheir leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\\nin the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\\nwould but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\\nof these miscreants must come out.\\n\\n\u201cUpon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\\nof treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\\nthe first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\\nmerit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\\nthem to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\\nleader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\\nthree sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\\n\\n\u201cThinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\\nallies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\\nmorning. \u2018Damn ye,\u2019 cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\\n\u2018the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!\u2019\\n\\n\u201cAt sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round\u2014thought, upon the\\nwhole, he would do so\u2014he ought to\u2014justice demanded it; but for the\\npresent, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\\na reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\u2019 turning to the three men in the\\nrigging\u2014\u2018for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;\u2019 and, seizing\\na rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\\ntraitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018My wrist is sprained with ye!\u2019 he cried, at last; \u2018but there is still\\nrope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn\u2019t give up.

Ever\\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\\nto his pinioned foe.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018You are a coward!\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018So I am, but take that.\u2019 The mate was in the very act of striking,\\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt\u2019s threat, whatever that\\nmight have been.

Still, no\\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\\nthat mainly at Steelkilt\u2019s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing\u2014namely,\\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\\nvital jaw of the whale.\\n\\n\u201cBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\\nthe chief mate\u2019s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\\n\\n\u201cDuring the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship\u2019s side. In\\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o\u2019clock, in the morning\\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\\nin his watches below.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018What are you making there?\u2019 said a shipmate.\\n\\n\u201c\u2018What do you think? what does it look like?\u2019\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\u2019s an odd one, seems to me.\u2019\\n\\n\u201c\u2018Yes, rather oddish,\u2019 said the Lakeman, holding it at arm\u2019s length\\nbefore him; \u2018but I think it will answer.

Do you think he won\u2019t do me a turn, when it\u2019s to help\\nhimself in the end, shipmate?\u2019 and going to the mate, he looked at him\\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\\nhim\u2014neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\\nLakeman\u2019s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\\nhelm\u2014nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\\ndug to the seaman\u2019s hand\u2014that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\\n\\n\u201cBut, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\\ndone.\\n\\n\u201cIt was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, \u2018There\\nshe rolls! there she rolls!\u2019 Jesu, what a whale!

All was now a phrensy.\\n\u2018The White Whale\u2014the White Whale!\u2019 was the cry from captain, mates, and\\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\\ncapture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\\naskance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\\npervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\\nbefore the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\\nwere lowered, the mate\u2019s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale\u2019s topmost back.\\nNothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\\nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale\u2019s slippery back,\\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\\nand went down.\\n\\n\u201cMeantime, at the first tap of the boat\u2019s bottom, the Lakeman had\\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\\nagain, with some tatters of Radney\u2019s red woollen shirt, caught in the\\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\\n\\n\u201cIn good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\u2014a savage, solitary\\nplace\u2014where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\\n\\n\u201cThe ship\u2019s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\\nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\\nheavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\\nreinforcement to his crew.","parsed":{"summary":"The mutiny on board the Town-Ho is quelled, but the crew decides not to pursue any more whales in order to quickly reach port.

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\\n\\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\\nworld right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\\nwrong.\\n\\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\\nbe found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\\nchain-armor like Saladin\u2019s, and a helmeted head like St. George\u2019s; ever\\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\\npresentations of him.\\n\\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\\nto be the whale\u2019s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\\nthem actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale\u2019s majestic flukes.\\n\\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\\npainter\u2019s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\\nantediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido\u2019s picture of Perseus rescuing\\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\\nsame scene in his own \u201cPerseus Descending,\u201d make out one whit better.\\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors\u2019 Gate leading from the Thames\\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah\u2019s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\\nthe book-binder\u2019s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\\ndescending anchor\u2014as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\\nmany books both old and new\u2014that is a very picturesque but purely\\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\\nantique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\\ncall this book-binder\u2019s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\\nspecies of the Leviathan.\\n\\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\\nmanner of spouts, jets d\u2019eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\\ntitle-page of the original edition of the \u201cAdvancement of Learning\u201d you\\nwill find some curious whales.\\n\\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\\nby those who know. In old Harris\u2019s collection of voyages there are some\\nplates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\\nentitled \u201cA Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\u201d In one of those plates the\\nwhales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\\nperpendicular flukes.\\n\\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \u201cA Voyage round\\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.\u201d In this book is an outline purporting to\\nbe a \u201cPicture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\u201d\\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\\nthat it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\\nto a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\\nbow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!\\n\\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\\nbenefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\\nmistake. Look at that popular work \u201cGoldsmith\u2019s Animated Nature.\u201d In\\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\\n\u201cwhale\u201d and a \u201cnarwhale.\u201d I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.\\n\\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lac\xe9p\xe8de, a great\\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\\ncounterpart in nature.\\n\\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s Sperm Whale is\\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\\npencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\\n\\nAs for the sign-painters\u2019 whales seen in the streets hanging over the\\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\\nmariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\\npaint.","parsed":{"summary":"The author discusses the inaccurate depictions of whales in various forms of art and media, from ancient sculptures to scientific illustrations, and even sign-paintings of oil-dealers.","excerpt_1":"The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being.","excerpt_2":"In a word, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.","text_to_image":"A whale-ship moored alongside a whale.

Most of the scientific drawings have\\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\\nliving whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\\nat sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\\nof sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\\ninto the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\\nAnd, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\\nyet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\\nship\u2019s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\\nshape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\\ncatch.\\n\\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\\nJeremy Bentham\u2019s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\u2019s other leading personal\\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\\nleviathan\u2019s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\\nand little finger.

True, one portrait may hit the\\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him.

Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.\\n\\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\\nthat matter by.\\n\\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\\nColnett\u2019s, Huggins\u2019s, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s, and Beale\u2019s. In the previous\\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins\u2019s is far\\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale\u2019s is the best. All\\nBeale\u2019s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\\n\\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\\nbecause it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\\nhis living hunters.\\n\\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\\nanywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\\ntaken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\\nmonster\u2019s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\\ncould not draw so good a one.\\n\\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\\npecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\\nback. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\\nthe paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\\nraging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\\nglassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\\npowerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\\ninserted into his spout-hole.\\n\\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else\\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\\nlads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\\ncommotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\\nbeholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\\nbattles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\\nLights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\\ngallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\\n\\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\\nthey have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England\u2019s\\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\\nRight whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\\nwhale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\\nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\\nchopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\\nLeuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\\nfac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\\nto the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\\nthe Peace.\\n\\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\\n\u201cH. Durand.\u201d One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\\ninshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\\nsails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\\nis quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\\nthe very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\\nthe vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\\na quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\\nover a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\\nwith earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\\nexcited seamen.","parsed":{"summary":"The author discusses different published outlines of whales and whaling scenes, highlighting some of the more accurate French engravings.","excerpt_1":"In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might...while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.","excerpt_2":"The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside...","text_to_image":"A Sperm Whale rises from the ocean, with a boat partially balanced on its spine.

Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in\\nStone; in Mountains; in Stars.\\n\\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\\ncrippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted\\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\\nleg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\\namputation.\\n\\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\\nWhale-teeth, or ladies\u2019 busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner\u2019s\\nfancy.\\n\\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.\\n\\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark\u2019s tooth, that\\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\\ncost steady years of steady application.\\n\\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark\u2019s tooth, of\\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\\nthe Greek savage, Achilles\u2019s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\\nDurer.\\n\\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of\\nthe noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the\\nforecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much\\naccuracy.\\n\\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales\\nare seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\\nintents and purposes so labelled with \u201c_Hands off!_\u201d you cannot examine\\nthem closely enough to decide upon their merit.\\n\\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\\nyou will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\\nthem in a surf of green surges.\\n\\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.

Brit.\\n\\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows\\nof brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale\\nlargely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that\\nwe seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden\\nwheat.\\n\\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.\\n\\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their\\nscythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these\\nmonsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving\\nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*\\n\\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the \u201cBrazil Banks\u201d does\\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\\n\\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at\\nall reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when\\nthey paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms\\nlooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in\\nthe great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;\\neven so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species\\nof the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their\\nimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such\\nbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with\\nthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.\\n\\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the\\nthing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.\\n\\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\\nhave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of\\nall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\\nthough but a moment\u2019s consideration will teach, that however baby man\\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\\n\\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah\u2019s flood is not yet subsided;\\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\\n\\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\\nmiracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\\nswallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.\\n\\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the\\nrocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of\\nships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it.

The Line.\\n\\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\\nfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,\\nI have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\\n\\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\\nvapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\\nropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\\nto the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\\nthe sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\\nquantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\\nit must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\\ngeneral by no means adds to the rope\u2019s durability or strength, however\\nmuch it may give it compactness and gloss.\\n\\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\\nso durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\\nI will add (since there is an \xe6sthetics in all things), is much more\\nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\\nto behold.\\n\\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\\ntwenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\\nto three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\\nsomething over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\\nspirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\\nthough, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\\nbedded \u201csheaves,\u201d or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\\nhollow but the \u201cheart,\u201d or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\\nthe cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\\nrunning out, infallibly take somebody\u2019s arm, leg, or entire body off,\\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\\npossible wrinkles and twists.\\n\\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\\nthe boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\\nnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\\nrather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\\nthickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\\nconcentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\\nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\\n\\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\\nof ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\\narrangement is indispensable for common safety\u2019s sake; for were the\\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\\nminute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\\n\\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\\nupon the loom or handle of every man\u2019s oar, so that it jogs against his\\nwrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\\nsit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\\nextreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\\nboat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\\nstill a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp\u2014the\\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\\nthat connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\\ntedious to detail.\\n\\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\\nwoman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\\nand while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit\u2014strange thing! what\\ncannot habit accomplish?\u2014Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\\nand brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you\\nwill hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus\\nhung in hangman\u2019s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before\\nKing Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of\\ndeath, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.\\n\\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those\\nrepeated whaling disasters\u2014some few of which are casually chronicled\u2014of\\nthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\\nFor, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is\\nlike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\\nsteam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\\nwheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\\nthe heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\\nand you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\\nnever pierce you out.\\n\\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\\ncontains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\\npowder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\\nline, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\\ninto actual play\u2014this is a thing which carries more of true terror than\\nany other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men\\nlive enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.","parsed":{"summary":"The passage describes the whale-line used in the fishery.

For this part of the Indian Ocean\\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\\n\\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\\nin what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\\nthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of\\nmy body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,\\nlong after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\\n\\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\\nat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\\nswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\\nhelmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\\nwide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\\n\\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\\nhands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved\\nme; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not\\nforty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like\\nthe capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\\nhue, glistening in the sun\u2019s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\\nin the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\\nvapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of\\na warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\\nby some enchanter\u2019s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\\nat once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\\nall parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.\\n\\n\u201cClear away the boats! Luff!\u201d cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he\\ndashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\\n\\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples\\nas he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\\nAhab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\\nbut in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\\nboats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\\nthe noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\\nthe monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\\nand then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\\n\\n\u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\\nStubb\u2019s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\\nwas granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker\u2019s boat, and\\nmuch nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\\nhonor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\\nbecome aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\\nno longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\\nAnd still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the\\nassault.\\n\\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish.

Though\\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\\n\\n\u201cStart her, start her, my men! Don\u2019t hurry yourselves; take plenty of\\ntime\u2014but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\u2019s all,\u201d cried\\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \u201cStart her, now; give \u2019em\\nthe long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy\u2014start\\nher, all; but keep cool, keep cool\u2014cucumbers is the word\u2014easy,\\neasy\u2014only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the\\nburied dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys\u2014that\u2019s all.

The Dart.\\n\\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\n\\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\\nthe chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\\nuttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\\nloud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the\\ntop of one\u2019s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\\nstarted\u2014what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\\nfish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\\ncry\u2014\u201cStand up, and give it to him!\u201d He now has to drop and secure his\\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\\nsomehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\\nin a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\\nsuccessful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\\nand disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\\nmakes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted!\\n\\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\\nthemselves and every one else.

The Crotch.\\n\\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\\n\\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\\nbow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\\nthe harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\\nprow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\\nsnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\\nrifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\\nthe crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\\n\\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\\nis a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\\nthe instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\\nreceiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\\nhowever lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\\nhim.

Stubb\u2019s Supper.\\n\\nStubb\u2019s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a\\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\\nin the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\\nintervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\\nthe mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever\\nthey call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this\\ngrand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead\\nin bulk.\\n\\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod\u2019s\\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\\nmorning.\\n\\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\\nfrom the sound on the Pequod\u2019s decks, that all hands were preparing to\\ncast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\\ndeck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\\nlinks, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\\nthe head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\\nwith its black hull close to the vessel\u2019s and seen through the darkness\\nof the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two\u2014ship\\nand whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\\nreclines while the other remains standing.*\\n\\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\\nrelatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\\nput the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\\nsmall, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\\nBy adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\\nof the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\\nlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\\njunction with its broad flukes or lobes.\\n\\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\\non deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\\nunusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\\nmanifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\\nthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\\n\\n\u201cA steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\\nme one from his small!\u201d\\n\\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\\nthing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\\nthe current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\\nof the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\\ndesignated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\\n\\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\\nat the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb\\nthe only banqueter on whale\u2019s flesh that night. Mingling their\\nmumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\\nswarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\\nThe few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\\nslapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\\nsleepers\u2019 hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as\\nbefore you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\\nturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\\nthe whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\\nshark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\\nsurface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\\na part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\\non the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\\ncountersinking for a screw.\\n\\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\\nwill be seen longingly gazing up to the ship\u2019s decks, like hungry dogs\\nround a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\\nkilled man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\\nbutchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other\u2019s\\nlive meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\\nalso, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\\nunder the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the\\nwhole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,\\nthat is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;\\nand though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy\\nin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be\\ndecently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be\\nset down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do\\nmost socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\\nconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\\nnumbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\\nwhale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen\\nthat sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\\n\\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\\ngoing on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of\\nhis own epicurean lips.\\n\\n\u201cCook, cook!\u2014where\u2019s that old Fleece?\u201d he cried at length, widening his\\nlegs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;\\nand, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing\\nwith his lance; \u201ccook, you cook!\u2014sail this way, cook!\u201d","parsed":{"summary":"The crew tows Stubb\'s whale to the Pequod and secures it for the night; Ahab seems dissatisfied and preoccupied with Moby Dick.

The Whale as a Dish.\\n\\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\\nlike Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\\noutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\\nphilosophy of it.\\n\\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\\nprices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth\u2019s time, a certain cook of the\\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\\neaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\\nwhale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\\nwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\\nThe old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\\nporpoise grant from the crown.\\n\\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\\nlong, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\\nnot so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\\nold vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\\ndoctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\\njuicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\\nlong ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel\u2014that\\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \u201cfritters\u201d; which, indeed,\\nthey greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\\nlike old Amsterdam housewives\u2019 dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\\nThey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\\nhardly keep his hands off.\\n\\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\\nbuffalo\u2019s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\\nsome other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\\nof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\\nship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\\na good supper have I thus made.\\n\\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\\ndish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two\\nplump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large\\npuddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most\\ndelectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves\u2019 head, which is\\nquite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young\\nbucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves\u2019 brains, by\\nand by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to\\ntell a calf\u2019s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with\\nan intelligent looking calf\u2019s head before him, is somehow one of the\\nsaddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\\nhim, with an \u201cEt tu Brute!\u201d expression.\\n\\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration\\nbefore mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\\nof the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man\\nthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was\\nhung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would\\nhave been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\\nstaring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\\ntake a tooth out of the cannibal\u2019s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a\\ncannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\\nsalted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it\\nwill be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of\\njudgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\\npat\xe9-de-foie-gras.\\n\\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\\nadding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is\\nthat handle made of?\u2014what but the bones of the brother of the very ox\\nyou are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring\\nthat fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl.

The Shark Massacre.\\n\\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general\\nthing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\\nhim in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\\nsoon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\\ncommon usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a\u2019lee; and then send\\nevery one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\\nthat, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\\ntwo for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\\nto see that all goes well.\\n\\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\\nnot answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\\nround the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\\nstretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\\nmost other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\\nprocedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\\ntickle them into still greater activity.

But in the foamy\\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\\nincredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\\neach other\u2019s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\\nbit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\\nby the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound.

The ivory Pequod was\\nturned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would\\nhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\\n\\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and\\nwhich no single man can possibly lift\u2014this vast bunch of grapes was\\nswayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\\nstrongest point anywhere above a ship\u2019s deck. The end of the\\nhawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\\nto the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\\nthe whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\\nside, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\\nabove the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\\nsemicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\\nmain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\\nin one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\\ncareens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\\nof an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\\nfrighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\\nwhale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\\nhelping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\\nis heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\\nthe whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\\nthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as\\nthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\\nstripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\\nwater, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\\nline called the \u201cscarf,\u201d simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck\\nand Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and\\nindeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher\\nand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the\\nwindlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious\\nblood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and\\nevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\\n\\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\\nthis hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\\nwhat follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\\nto stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\\nfew sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\\ntwain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\\nstrip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\\nmain hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\\nplaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\\nand lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\\nheavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\\nscarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\\nway of assuaging the general friction.","parsed":{"summary":"The crew of the Pequod engages in cutting in a whale on a Sabbath night, with sailors acting as butchers.

The Blanket.\\n\\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\\nof the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced\\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion\\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\\n\\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\\nknow what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\\nof firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\\n\\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\\ncreature\u2019s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\\nwhale\u2019s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\\nyour hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\\nflexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\\nnot only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\\nmagnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\\nthrough their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\\nhere is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\\nnew-born child. But no more of this.\\n\\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\\nor rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\\nfourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\\nquarters of the stuff of the whale\u2019s skin.\\n\\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\\nengravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\\nif they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\\nuse in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\\nwith a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\\nLike those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\\nwith vast floating icebergs\u2014I should say, that those rocks must not a\\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\\nfull-grown bulls of the species.\\n\\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\\nthis cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\\nhimself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\\nWhat would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\\nthese, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\\nbellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\\nlee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\\nfire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\\nblood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then\u2014except after\\nexplanation\u2014that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\\nhome, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\\nseamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\\nproved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\\nthat of a Borneo negro in summer.\\n\\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\\nvirtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself\\nafter the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,\\nlive in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep\\nthy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter\u2019s, and\\nlike the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\\nthine own.\\n\\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!

The Jeroboam\u2019s Story.\\n\\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than\\nthe ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\\n\\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger\u2019s boats and manned mast-heads\\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\\nshooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\\nresponse would be made.\\n\\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility.\\n\\nThe Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting\\nher own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\\nSquaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee,\\nand lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was\\nbeing rigged by Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain,\\nthe stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token\\nof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the\\nJeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\u2019s company. For, though\\nhimself and boat\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\\nof the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\\nthe Pequod.\\n\\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam\u2019s\\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to\\nthe Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it\\nblew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\\nby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\\nsome way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\\nbearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now\\nand then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at\\nintervals not without still another interruption of a very different\\nsort.\\n\\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam\u2019s boat, was a man of a singular\\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\\nhis wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\\n\\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\\nexclaimed\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s he! that\u2019s he!\u2014the long-togged scaramouch the\\nTown-Ho\u2019s company told us of!\u201d Stubb here alluded to a strange story\\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\\nJeroboam. His story was this:\\n\\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\\nShakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\\ntrap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\\ncarried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing\\ngunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,\\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\\nwhere, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\\nfor the Jeroboam\u2019s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\\nupon the ship\u2019s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\\na freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\\nhe declared these things;\u2014the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\\ndelirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\\nuse in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\\npleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\\napprised that that individual\u2019s intention was to land him in the first\\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\\nvials\u2014devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\\ncase this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\\nthem would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\\nwould they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\\nthe ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\\nreturn to the Pequod.\\n\\n\u201cI fear not thy epidemic, man,\u201d said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain\\nMayhew, who stood in the boat\u2019s stern; \u201ccome on board.\u201d\\n\\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\\n\\n\u201cThink, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!

Meantime, the\\nhoisted sperm whale\u2019s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\\nnature seemed to warrant.\\n\\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\\nleagued with him.","parsed":{"summary":"The Pequod encounters the Jeroboam, which has a sick crew member who refuses to come onboard.

But when, some\\nyear or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\\nopportunity, despite all the archangel\u2019s denunciations and\\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\\nfast.

Now, while\\nMacey, the mate, was standing up in his boat\u2019s bow, and with all the\\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsman\u2019s head; but the mate for ever sank.\\n\\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\\noftener the boat\u2019s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\\nheadsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.

Raising a piercing shriek\u2014\u201cThe vial! the vial!\u201d\\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\\nthe whale.

He became a nameless terror\\nto the ship.\\n\\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\\nAhab answered\u2014\u201cAye.\u201d Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\\nhis feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\\ndownward pointed finger\u2014\u201cThink, think of the blasphemer\u2014dead, and down\\nthere!\u2014beware of the blasphemer\u2019s end!\u201d\\n\\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \u201cCaptain, I have just\\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\\nofficers, if I mistake not.

The Monkey-Rope.\\n\\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale\u2019s back, the\\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\\ndescend upon the monster\u2019s back for the special purpose referred to.\\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\\nin the Highland costume\u2014a shirt and socks\u2014in which to my eyes, at\\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.\\n\\nBeing the savage\u2019s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\\nwhale\u2019s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\\na long cord. Just so, from the ship\u2019s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\\nwaist.\\n\\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\\nends; fast to Queequeg\u2019s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\\nentailed.\\n\\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\\nthat while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\\ncompany of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that\\nanother\u2019s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\\ndisaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering\u2014while I jerked\\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\\nto jam him\u2014still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg\u2019s\\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\\n\\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\\nmonkey-rope holder.\\n\\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\\nwhale and the ship\u2014where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\\npent blood which began to flow from the carcass\u2014the rabid creatures\\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\\n\\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\\n\\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\\nthem. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious shark\u2014he was provided with still another\\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\\nDaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg\u2019s best happiness, I admit; but\\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\\nwater, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\\nleg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\\nthere with that great iron hook\u2014poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\\nto his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\\n\\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea\u2014what matters\\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\\nin this whaling world?

Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\\nover Him.\\n\\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale\u2019s\\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod\u2019s side. But we must let it\\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\\nit. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for\\nthe head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\\n\\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\\nif opportunity offered.\\n\\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\\nboats, Stubb\u2019s and Flask\u2019s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\\nand further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\\nthe mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\\ntumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\\nboth the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\\nplain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\\ntowing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\\nit seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\\nview, as if diving under the keel. \u201cCut, cut!\u201d was the cry from the\\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel\u2019s side. But having plenty\\nof line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\\nwas intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\\nline in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\\ncircuit.\\n\\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;\\nand thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale\u2019s body,\\nrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every\\nnew gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains\\nthat poured from the smitten rock.\\n\\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\\nturned upon his back a corpse.\\n\\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\\nand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\\nconversation ensued between them.\\n\\n\u201cI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\u201d said\\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\\nignoble a leviathan.\\n\\n\u201cWants with it?\u201d said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\u2019s bow,\\n\u201cdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale\u2019s\\nhead hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right\\nWhale\u2019s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can\\nnever afterwards capsize?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhy not?\\n\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,\\nand he seems to know all about ships\u2019 charms.

But nothing like this, in the present\\ncase, had been done.

The Sperm Whale\u2019s Head\u2014Contrasted View.\\n\\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\\njoin them, and lay together our own.\\n\\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\u2019s side; and as we\\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\\ndeck:\u2014where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\\nstudy practical cetology than here?\\n\\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\u2019s which the Right\\nWhale\u2019s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale\u2019s head.\\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\\nis what the fishermen technically call a \u201cgrey-headed whale.\u201d\\n\\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads\u2014namely, the two\\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale\u2019s jaw, if you\\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\\nfancy to be a young colt\u2019s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\\nmagnitude of the head.\\n\\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\u2019s eyes, it is\\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale\u2019s\\neyes corresponds to that of a man\u2019s ears; and you may fancy, for\\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\\nthe front of a man\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\\n\\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\\nthe whale\u2019s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\\nwhale\u2019s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\\n\\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\\nhint. So long as a man\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one\u2019s experience\\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\\ncompletely, to examine any two things\u2014however large or however small\u2014at\\none and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\u2019s, that he can at the\\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\\ncan, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\\nproblems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\\nincongruity in this comparison.\\n\\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\\n\\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\\nhours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\\n\\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\\nwhich is smaller than a hare\u2019s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\\nof Herschel\u2019s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\\ncathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\\nhearing? Not at all.\u2014Why then do you try to \u201cenlarge\u201d your mind?\\nSubtilize it.\\n\\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\\nover the sperm whale\u2019s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\\nby a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\\nthat the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\\nmight descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\\nlet us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\\na really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\\nlined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\\nbridal satins.\\n\\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\\nship\u2019s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\\nhim.","parsed":{"summary":"The Sperm Whale and the Right Whale, the two whales regularly hunted by man, differ in their heads - the Sperm Whale has a more symmetric and character-filled head with grey color indicating advanced age, while both whales have peculiar sideways positioned eyes that impairs their frontal vision.","excerpt_1":"In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit...he is what the fishermen technically call a \u201cgrey-headed whale.\u201d","excerpt_2":"But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.","text_to_image":"Two large whales laying their heads together, but with contrasting heads - one has a grey head at the summit, while the other\'s head sadly lacks mathematical symmetry.

The Right Whale\u2019s Head\u2014Contrasted View.\\n\\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\\nWhale\u2019s head.\\n\\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale\u2019s head may be compared to a\\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale\u2019s head bears a rather\\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\\nshoemaker\u2019s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\\nlodged, she and all her progeny.\\n\\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\\nits sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass\u2014this green,\\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the \u201ccrown,\u201d and the\\nSouthern fishers the \u201cbonnet\u201d of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\\nwith a bird\u2019s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\\ntechnical term \u201ccrown\u201d also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\\ncarpenter\u2019s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\\n\\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\\nthreshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\\nMackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\\nLord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\\nhigh, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\\nsay three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\\nhead or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\\nbeen cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\\nhairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\\nbone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\\ncreature\u2019s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\\nwill seem reasonable.\\n\\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\\n\u201cwhiskers\u201d inside of the whale\u2019s mouth;* another, \u201chogs\u2019 bristles\u201d; a\\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\\n\u201cThere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.\u201d\\n\\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\\nrather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\\ncountenance.\\n\\nAs every one knows, these same \u201chogs\u2019 bristles,\u201d \u201cfins,\u201d \u201cwhiskers,\u201d\\n\u201cblinds,\u201d or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\\nother stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\\nlong been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne\u2019s time that the bone was\\nin its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\\nancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\\nyou may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\\ntent spread over the same bone.\\n\\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\\nstanding in the Right Whale\u2019s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\\nthink you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\\nTurkey\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\\namount of oil.\\n\\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\\nwith\u2014that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale\u2019s there is no\\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale\u2019s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\\nanything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\\n\\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\\nlie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other\\nwill not be very long in following.\\n\\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale\u2019s there? It is the same\\nhe died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now\\nfaded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\\nplacidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the\\nother head\u2019s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\\naccident against the vessel\u2019s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.\\nDoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\\nresolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\\nhis latter years.","parsed":{"summary":"The Right Whale\'s head is described as bearing an inelegant resemblance to a gigantic, galliot-toed shoe and has different aspects depending on one\'s point of view.

The Battering-Ram.\\n\\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\u2019s head, I would have you,\\nas a sensible physiologist, simply\u2014particularly remark its front\\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\\nbe lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,\\nperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\\n\\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\\nsocket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\\nmouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\\nhas\u2014his spout hole\u2014is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\\nand ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\\nfront of the Sperm Whale\u2019s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\\nnow to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\\nas one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\\npartly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\\napparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\\nJust so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\\nenvelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\\nby any man who has not handled it.

It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\\nwith horses\u2019 hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\\n\\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\\ntoughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\\nout of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\\nenvelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\\ndestructive of all elements contributes.\\n\\nNow, mark.

But to comprehend it aright, you must\\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\\nupon.\\n\\nRegarding the Sperm Whale\u2019s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.\\n\\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\\nsides.\\n\\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\\noil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\\nextent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\\nmystically carved in front, so the whale\u2019s vast plaited forehead forms\\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water.

Cistern and Buckets.\\n\\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\\nposture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\\npart where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\\nlands on the summit of the head. There\u2014still high elevated above the\\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries\u2014he seems some Turkish\\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\\na dairy-maid\u2019s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\\ndown.\\n\\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once\\na queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild\\nIndian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\\none-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or\\nwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\\nwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\\nstating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling\\nnow; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\\nsuckingly up\u2014my God! poor Tashtego\u2014like the twin reciprocating bucket\\nin a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\\nHeidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of\\nsight!\\n\\n\u201cMan overboard!\u201d cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\\ncame to his senses. \u201cSwing the bucket this way!\u201d and putting one foot\\ninto it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\\nitself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\\nbefore Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there\\nwas a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\\ndepth to which he had sunk.\\n\\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\\nthe whip\u2014which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles\u2014a\\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\\nmotions of the head.\\n\\n\u201cCome down, come down!\u201d yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\\n\\n\u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, man,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201care you ramming home a cartridge\\nthere?\u2014Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on\\ntop of his head? Avast, will ye!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cStand clear of the tackle!\u201d cried a voice like the bursting of a\\nrocket.\\n\\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara\u2019s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging\u2014now over the\\nsailors\u2019 heads, and now over the water\u2014Daggoo, through a thick mist of\\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\\nship.\\n\\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\\nupright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\\nforth from the grass over a grave.\\n\\n\u201cBoth! both!\u2014it is both!\u201d\u2014cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\\nsoon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\\nwith the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\\n\\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;\u2014he had\\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\\nthe good old way\u2014head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\\ndoing as well as could be expected.\\n\\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\\nand boxing, riding and rowing.\\n\\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\u2019s will be sure to\\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\\neither seen or heard of some one\u2019s falling into a cistern ashore; an\\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\\nthe Indian\u2019s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\\nSperm Whale\u2019s well.","parsed":{"summary":"Tashtego climbs the mainyard to get to the hoisted Tun, where he searches for the proper place to access the cistern, secured by a bucket attached to a whip.

The Prairie.\\n\\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\\nas yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as\\nfor Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of\\nthe various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of\\nhorses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of\\nthese two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all\\nthings; I achieve what I can.\\n\\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\\nnose from Phidias\u2019s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\\nroyal beadle on his throne.\\n\\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\\naspect is sublime.\\n\\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\\nthe elephant\u2019s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\\ndecrees. It signifies\u2014\u201cGod: done this day by my hand.\u201d But in most\\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\\nlike Shakespeare\u2019s or Melancthon\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low,\\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\\nand all above them in the forehead\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the\\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\\ndepression in the forehead\u2019s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\u2019s mark\\nof genius.\\n\\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove\u2019s high seat, the great\\nSperm Whale shall lord it.\\n\\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\u2019s and every being\u2019s\\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\\nfable.

The Nut.\\n\\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\\nsquare.\\n\\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\\nbase. But in life\u2014as we have elsewhere seen\u2014this inclined plane is\\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater\u2014in\\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\\ndepth\u2014reposes the mere handful of this monster\u2019s brain. The brain is at\\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\\n\\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\\nthe creature\u2019s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\\ncommon world.\\n\\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men\u2019s skulls, and you would\\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say\u2014This man\\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\\n\\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\u2019s proper brain, you\\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped\u2019s spine, you\\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebr\xe6 to a strung\\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebr\xe6 are absolutely\\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\\nthe vertebr\xe6 of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man\u2019s\\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\\nworld.\\n\\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\\nit passes through the remaining vertebr\xe6 the canal tapers in size, but\\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance\u2014the\\nspinal cord\u2014as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain\u2019s\\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whale\u2019s spine phrenologically?\\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.\\n\\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\\nSperm Whale\u2019s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\\nof the larger vertebr\xe6, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\\nreason to know.","parsed":{"summary":"The Sperm Whale\'s brain is hidden behind its huge skull, making its large head a false appearance.

They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\\na great wide parchment upon the sea.\\n\\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\\nhim to upbubble.\\n\\n\u201cWho\u2019s got some paregoric?\u201d said Stubb, \u201che has the stomach-ache, I\u2019m\\nafraid.

Whether he had lost\\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.\\n\\n\u201cOnly wait a bit, old chap, and I\u2019ll give ye a sling for that wounded\\narm,\u201d cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\\n\\n\u201cMind he don\u2019t sling thee with it,\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cGive way, or the\\nGerman will have him.\u201d\\n\\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\\nfish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequod\u2019s keels had shot by the three\\nGerman boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\\nDerick\u2019s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\\nforeign rivals.

An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\\nwhale\u2019s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\\nthe foaming swell that he made.\\n\\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\\nin the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin.

Blinding vapors of foam and\\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale\u2019s headlong\\nrush, bumped the German\u2019s aside with such force, that both Derick and\\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\\nflying keels.\\n\\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\u201d cried Stubb, casting a passing\\nglance upon them as he shot by; \u201cye\u2019ll be picked up presently\u2014all\\nright\u2014I saw some sharks astern\u2014St. Bernard\u2019s dogs, you know\u2014relieve\\ndistressed travellers.

Hurrah! this\\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!\u201d\\n\\nBut the monster\u2019s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\\nlast\u2014owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue\u2014the\\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\\nsome time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \u201cholding on,\u201d as\\nit is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\\nthe back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\\nperil of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\\nthe best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\\nowing to the enormous surface of him\u2014in a full grown sperm whale\\nsomething less than 2000 square feet\u2014the pressure of the water is\\nimmense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\\nourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\\nvast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\\nhundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\\natmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\\nline-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\\nboard.\\n\\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\\nwhat landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\\nplacidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\\nagony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\\nSeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\\nto what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\\nonce so triumphantly said\u2014\u201cCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\\nor his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\\ncannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\u201d This the creature? this he? Oh!\\nthat unfulfilments should follow the prophets.

The next moment, relieved in great part\\nfrom the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\\nupwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\\nscared from it into the sea.\\n\\n\u201cHaul in!

In most land\\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\\nwhereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\\nshut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\\npeculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\\nblood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\\nharpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\\nsystem; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\\npour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\\nblood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\\nhe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\\nas in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\\nof far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\\nupon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\\nlances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\\nnew made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\\nspout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\\ncame, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\\nas they significantly call it, was untouched.\\n\\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\\nhis form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\\nrevealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\\nbeheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\\nnoblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale\u2019s eyes\\nhad once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\\nBut pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\\nblind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\\nthe gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\\nall. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\\nstrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low\\ndown on the flank.\\n\\n\u201cA nice spot,\u201d cried Flask; \u201cjust let me prick him there once.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cthere\u2019s no need of that!\u201d\\n\\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\\nfury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\\ncrews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask\u2019s boat and marring\\nthe bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\\nby loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\\nmade; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\\nwhite secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\\nground\u2014so the last long dying spout of the whale.\\n\\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\\nImmediately, by Starbuck\u2019s orders, lines were secured to it at\\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\\nheedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\\nto her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\\nbody would at once sink to the bottom.\\n\\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\\nflesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\\nstumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\\nwhales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\\nof any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\\nbeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\\nthe ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\\nlance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\\nwhen? It might have been darted by some Nor\u2019 West Indian long before\\nAmerica was discovered.\\n\\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\\ncabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\\ndiscoveries, by the ship\u2019s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\\nto the sea, owing to the body\u2019s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\\nHowever, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\\nthe last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\\nship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\\nthe body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\\nwas the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\\nfluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\\nthem off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\\nother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\\nhouse. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\\nimmovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\\nlow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\\nall approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\\nadded to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\\nover.\\n\\n\u201cHold on, hold on, won\u2019t ye?\u201d cried Stubb to the body, \u201cdon\u2019t be in\\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\\nor go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\\nand run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\\nchains.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cKnife? Aye, aye,\u201d cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\u2019s heavy\\nhatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\\nat the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\\ngiven, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\\nsnap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\\n\\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\\nis not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\\nnoble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\\nlife, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\\nbuoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\\n\\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\\nRight Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\\nin no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\\nhis Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\\nincumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\\nwhere, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\\nagain rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\\nobvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\\nmagnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\\namong the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\\nsinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\\nthe body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\\nhave ascended again.\\n\\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\\nthe Pequod\u2019s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\\nlowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\\nits incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back\u2019s spout is\\nso similar to the Sperm Whale\u2019s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\\noften mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\\nsail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\\nfar to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\\n\\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.","parsed":{"summary":"The hunters continue to pursue the wounded whale despite his extreme exhaustion and bleeding.

The Honor and Glory of Whaling.\\n\\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the\\ntrue method.\\n\\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\\nto the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its\\ngreat honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many\\ngreat demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other\\nhave shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection\\nthat I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\\nfraternity.\\n\\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to\\nthe eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale\\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\\nThose were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms\\nto succor the distressed, and not to fill men\u2019s lamp-feeders. Every one\\nknows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely\\nAndromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,\\nand as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the\\nprince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and\\ndelivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\\nthis Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\\nthis Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\\ncoast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\\nskeleton of a whale, which the city\u2019s legends and all the inhabitants\\nasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\\nWhen the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\\ntriumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\\nstory, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\n\\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda\u2014indeed, by some supposed\\nto be indirectly derived from it\u2014is that famous story of St. George and\\nthe Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many\\nold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and\\noften stand for each other. \u201cThou art as a lion of the waters, and as a\\ndragon of the sea,\u201d saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in\\ntruth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it\\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\\nwith the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\\na Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\\nboldly up to a whale.\\n\\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\\nand considering that as in Perseus\u2019 case, St. George\u2019s whale might have\\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\\nridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\\nbearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible\\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.\\nIn fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story\\nwill fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse\u2019s\\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the\\nstump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble\\nstamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by\\ngood rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\\nnoble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\\nwith a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer\\nwith disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\\nare much better entitled to St. George\u2019s decoration than they.\\n\\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\\nantique Crockett and Kit Carson\u2014that brawny doer of rejoicing good\\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that\\nstrictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere\\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from\\nthe inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\\nclaim him for one of our clan.\\n\\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\\nancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice vers\xe2; certainly\\nthey are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the\\nprophet?\\n\\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\\nroll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like\\nroyal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in\\nnothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental\\nstory is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread\\nVishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives\\nus this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first\\nof his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified\\nthe whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved\\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave\\nbirth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical\\nbooks, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo\\nbefore beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,\\nrescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even\\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?\\n\\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there\u2019s a\\nmember-roll for you!

Jonah Historically Regarded.\\n\\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\\nthe preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\\nhistorical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\\nsceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans\\nof their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,\\nand Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did\\nnot make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\\n\\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\\nstory was this:\u2014He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\\nJonah\u2019s whale with two spouts in his head\u2014a peculiarity only true with\\nrespect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\\nvarieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\\nsaying, \u201cA penny roll would choke him\u201d; his swallow is so very small.\\nBut, to this, Bishop Jebb\u2019s anticipative answer is ready. It is not\\nnecessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\\nwhale\u2019s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\\nthis seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right\\nWhale\u2019s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\\ncomfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\\nensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\\nWhale is toothless.\\n\\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whale\u2019s gastric juices. But\\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\\nsupposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\\n_dead_ whale\u2014even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\\ntheir dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\\nbeen divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\\nthrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his\\nescape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a\\nfigure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \u201cThe Whale,\u201d as some\\ncraft are nowadays christened the \u201cShark,\u201d the \u201cGull,\u201d the \u201cEagle.\u201d Nor\\nhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\\nwhale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver\u2014an\\ninflated bag of wind\u2014which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\\nsaved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\\nwithin three days\u2019 journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\\nmore than three days\u2019 journey across from the nearest point of the\\nMediterranean coast. How is that?\\n\\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\\nthat short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by\\nthe way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\\nthrough the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\\nthe Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\\ncomplete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\\nthe Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\\nwhale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\u2019s weathering the Cape of\\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\\nso make modern history a liar.\\n\\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\\nfoolish pride of reason\u2014a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\\nthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\\nsun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\\nabominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\\nPortuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah\u2019s going to Nineveh\\nvia the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\\ngeneral miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\\nenlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\\nAnd some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris\u2019s\\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which\\nMosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator discusses the story of Jonah and the whale, and notes that some Nantucketers question its historical accuracy, while others connect it to various assumptions.","excerpt_1":"\'A penny roll would choke him,\' says the text, referring to the size of the Right Whale\'s swallow.","excerpt_2":"The text notes that Sag-Harbor\'s arguments reveal his foolish pride of reason, his lack of learning, and his impious pride and rebellion against the clergy.","text_to_image":"An image of a quaint, old-fashioned Bible embellished with curious, unscientific plates, depicting Jonah\'s whale with two spouts in his head."},"image":null},{"merge":"C084.01","passage":"\\n\\n 84. Pitchpoling.\\n\\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\\nbe of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\\nhostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\\nmake the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\\nhis boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\\ndisappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in\\nthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\\nfrom the craft\u2019s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to\\nsome particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the\\nevent.\\n\\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\\nthem, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered\\nflight, as of Cleopatra\u2019s barges from Actium.\\n\\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb\u2019s was foremost. By great\\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\\nflight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\\nimperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\\nhaul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\\nfurious.

Small\\nsword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact\\nand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\\naccurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\\nheadway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or\\ntwelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material\u2014pine. It is furnished with a\\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\\nhauled back to the hand after darting.\\n\\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\\nseldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\\ngeneral thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before\\nany pitchpoling comes into play.\\n\\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\\nin pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\\nflying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\\nahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\\nits length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\\nup the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\\nhis grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\\nbefore his waistband\u2019s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\\ncovering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air.

The Fountain.\\n\\nThat for six thousand years\u2014and no one knows how many millions of ages\\nbefore\u2014the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\\nsprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\\nwhale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings\u2014that all this should\\nbe, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\\nminutes past one o\u2019clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\\nafter all, really water, or nothing but vapor\u2014this is surely a\\nnoteworthy thing.\\n\\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\\ncod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\\nregular lungs, like a human being\u2019s, the whale can only live by\\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\\nin any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\\nthe Sperm Whale\u2019s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\\nsurface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\\nmouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\\ntop of his head.\\n\\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\\ncase with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\\nhour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\\nno gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\\nvermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\\nmore, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\\nsupplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\\nindisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\\nand true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\\nas the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\\nrising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\\nstays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\\nbreaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\\nseventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\\nbreaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\\nagain to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\\nseventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\\nare different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\\nthat this necessity for the whale\u2019s rising exposes him to all the fatal\\nhazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\\nleviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\\nsunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\\nnecessities that strike the victory to thee!\\n\\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on\u2014one breath only serving for\\ntwo or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\\nattend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\\nSperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\\n\\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\\nof smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout\u2014whether it be water\\nor whether it be vapor\u2014no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\\non this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\\nproper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\\nviolets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\\n\\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\\ncanal, and as that long canal\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\u2014is furnished\\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\\ntalks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\\nworld, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\\n\\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\\nthis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\\nof the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\\nspiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s\\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\\nrespiration.\\n\\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\\nknottiest of all.

To the student of old Roman\\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\\ngreat strength of the masonry.\\n\\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\\n\\nNor does this\u2014its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\\nappalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\\nharmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\\nWhen Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\\nrobustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\\nthe Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\\nthe mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\\nall hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\\nteachings.\\n\\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\\nno fairy\u2019s arm can transcend it.\\n\\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\\nFourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\n\\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan\u2019s tail acts in a\\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\\nwhen furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\\n\\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\\ndashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\\nmost serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\\nin the fishery, that they are accounted mere child\u2019s play. Some one\\nstrips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\\n\\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\\nelephant\u2019s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor\u2019s whisker, woe to that sailor,\\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\\nDarmonodes\u2019 elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\\ntrunk and extracted the dart.\\n\\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole.\\n\\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_\u2014somewhere\\nelse to be described\u2014this peaking of the whale\u2019s flukes is perhaps the\\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator celebrates the tail of the Sperm Whale, describing its strength and beauty.

The Grand Armada.\\n\\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast\\nmole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\\ndividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are\\nthe straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,\\nvessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.\\n\\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with\\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\\ntheir claim to more solid tribute.\\n\\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.\\n\\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,\\nand gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season\\nthere. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost\\nall the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to\\ndescending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere\\nelse foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\\nDick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\\n\\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\\ncrew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,\\nnow, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\\nno sustenance but what\u2019s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\\nwhole lake\u2019s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\\nutilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\\ncarries years\u2019 water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,\\nfrom the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at\\na score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have\\nsighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating\\nseamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that\\nanother flood had come; they would only answer\u2014\u201cWell, boys, here\u2019s the\\nark!\u201d\\n\\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\\nmore upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\\nof singular magnificence saluted us.\\n\\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive\\nherds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost\\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of\\nthe Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now\\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by\\na single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\\nthousands on thousands.\\n\\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\\ncontinuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the\\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of\\nthe Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\\nrising and falling away to leeward.\\n\\nSeen from the Pequod\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\\n\\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\\ntheir rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the\\nplain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward\\nthrough the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their\\nsemicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\\n\\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet\\nsuspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\\nDick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.","parsed":{"summary":"As the Pequod approaches the straits of Sunda on the way to Japan, Ahab hopes to encounter sperm whales known to frequent the area.

It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\\ndisappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\\nin his pivot-hole, crying, \u201cAloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\\nwet the sails;\u2014Malays, sir, and after us!\u201d\\n\\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\\nfairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in\\nhot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.

As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\\nseemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\\ndeadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\\ntheir curses;\u2014when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\\nAhab\u2019s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\\nfirm thing from its place.\\n\\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\\nship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\\nspring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\\nwonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\\nkeels that were after them,\u2014though as yet a mile in their rear,\u2014than\\nthey rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\\non with redoubled velocity.\\n\\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\\nafter several hours\u2019 pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\\nchase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\\ntoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\\nperplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it\\nin the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in\\nwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\\nbroken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus\u2019 elephants in\\nthe Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\\nbeings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre\u2019s pit,\\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\\nother to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\\nstrangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\\n\\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes\u2019 time,\\nQueequeg\u2019s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\\nstraight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\\nof the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\\nfishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\\nfrantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\\ndelirious throb.\\n\\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed.\\n\\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\\nfrom that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\\ntime, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\\nway whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no\\ntime to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\\nthe shouting part of the business. \u201cOut of the way, Commodore!\u201d cried\\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. \u201cHard down with your tail,\\nthere!\u201d cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\\n\\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\\nequal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\\nother\u2019s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\\nsperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\\nmust kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\\nmust wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\\nHence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\\nrequisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\\nsecond were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\\nrunning off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\\ndrugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\\nupon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\\nwooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\\nboat\u2019s bottom as the seat slid from under him.

So\\nthat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\\nsideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\\nmomentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\\nshoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\\nvalley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\\nwhales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\\npresented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\\nthe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\\nYes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\\nheart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\\nbeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\\npods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\\nlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\\nmiddle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\\ndensity of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\\nthe embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\\npresent afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\\nhemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\\nup. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\\nsmall tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.\\n\\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\\nany one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\\nthe whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\\nmiles. At any rate\u2014though indeed such a test at such a time might be\\ndeceptive\u2014spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\\ncircumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\\nlocked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\\nhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\\nwhales\u2014now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\\nlake\u2014evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\\nand touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\\ntheir backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\\ntime refrained from darting it.\\n\\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\\nmothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\\ndifferent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;\u2014even so\\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\\nus, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\\nof these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\\nfeet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\\noccupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\\nfor the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar\u2019s bow.\\nThe delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby\u2019s ears newly arrived\\nfrom foreign parts.\\n\\n\u201cLine! line!\u201d cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \u201chim fast! him\\nfast!\u2014Who line him! Who struck?\u2014Two whale; one big, one little!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat ails ye, man?\u201d cried Starbuck.\\n\\n\u201cLook-e here,\u201d said Queequeg, pointing down.\\n\\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\\nof Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\\nits dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\\nnatural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\\nhempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\\nsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\\nsaw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\\n\\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\\none at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\\nEsau and Jacob:\u2014a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\\ncuriously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\\nthemselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\\nparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter\u2019s lance, the mother\u2019s\\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\\nwith strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\\nsalute _more hominum_.\\n\\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\\nfearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\\nin dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\\nand while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\\nand deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\\ndismay wherever he went.\\n\\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\\nthe intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\\nhad become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\\ncomrades.\\n\\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\\nhalf spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\\ncentre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\\nStarbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.\\n\\n\u201cOars!

Schools and Schoolmasters.\\n\\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\\nvast aggregations.\\n\\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\\n\\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\\nendearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\\nconcubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\\nthan one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.\\n\\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\\nleisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\\nlounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\\nthe Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year.\\n\\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\\nwhat the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\\nhis bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\\nthe whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\\nfence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\\nantlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\\nencounters,\u2014furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\\ninstances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\\n\\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\\nthe first rush of the harem\u2019s lord, then is it very diverting to watch\\nthat lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\\nrevels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\\nlike pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\\nGranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\\nchase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\\nof their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\\nsons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\\nLord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\\nand so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\\nover the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\\nthe ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\\nreflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\\novertakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\\nlove for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\\nadmonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\\nan exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians\\nand parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from\\nhis amorous errors.\\n\\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is\\nthe lord and master of that school technically known as the\\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however\\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then\\ngo abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\\nHis title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\\nname bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the\\nman who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read\\nthe memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and\\nwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of\\nhis pupils.\\n\\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\\nWhales. Almost universally, a lone whale\u2014as a solitary Leviathan is\\ncalled\u2014proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,\\nhe will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to\\nwife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though\\nshe keeps so many moody secrets.\\n\\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while\\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.\\n\\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\\nmob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about\\nin quest of settlements, that is, harems.\\n\\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is\\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\\nForty-barrel-bull\u2014poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a\\nmember of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\\nthemselves to fall a prey.","parsed":{"summary":"The chapter discusses the harem and school of whales, including differences between the male and female schools as well as the behavior of the schoolmaster whales.","excerpt_1":"In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude... surrounded by all the solaces and endearments of the harem.","excerpt_2":"The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.

Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.\\n\\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\\n\\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\\nexample,\u2014after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the\\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.\\n\\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian\u2019s Pandects and the By-laws of the\\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People\u2019s\\nBusiness. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne\u2019s farthing,\\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.\\n\\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\n\\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\n\\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\\nexpound it.\\n\\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\\nall controllable by the occupant or occupants,\u2014a mast, an oar, a\\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\\nas their intention so to do.\\n\\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks\u2014the\\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\\nothers are by no means so scrupulous.\\n\\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs\u2019\\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\\nline, harpoons, and boat.\\n\\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\\njudge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife\u2019s\\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\\nbecame that subsequent gentleman\u2019s property, along with whatever\\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.\\n\\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\n\\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\\nlearned judge in set terms decided, to wit,\u2014That as for the boat, he\\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\\nsave their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\\n\\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\\npossibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\\nhas but two props to stand on.\\n\\nIs it not a saying in every one\u2019s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\\npossession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\\nRussian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\\nis the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow\u2019s\\nlast mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain\u2019s marble\\nmansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?\\nWhat is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor\\nWoebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone\u2019s family from\\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish?

What to that apostolic\\nlancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all\\nthese, is not Possession the whole of the law?\\n\\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\\ninternationally and universally applicable.\\n\\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\\nSpanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\\nmistress?

But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\\nbold to speak,\\n\\n\u201cPlease, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThe Duke.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWe have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\\nthat to go to the Duke\u2019s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our\\npains but our blisters?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIs the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\\ngetting a livelihood?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\\nthis whale.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWon\u2019t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\\n\\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people\u2019s business. Is this\\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\\n\\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\\nto the King and Queen, \u201cbecause of its superior excellence.\u201d And by the\\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\\nmatters.\\n\\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\\nfor that, ye lawyers!\\n\\nIn his treatise on \u201cQueen-Gold,\u201d or Queen-pinmoney, an old King\u2019s Bench\\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \u201cYe tail is ye Queen\u2019s,\\nthat ye Queen\u2019s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.\u201d Now this\\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\\nRight whale was largely used in ladies\u2019 bodices. But this same bone is\\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\\n\\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers\u2014the whale\\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown\u2019s ordinary revenue. I\\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.","parsed":{"summary":"The King of England has the right to the head of any whale caught on the coast, while the Queen gets the tail due to its use in corsets.

The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\\n\\n\u201cIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\u201d _Sir T. Browne,\\nV.E._\\n\\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\\nmany noses on the Pequod\u2019s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\\nwas smelt in the sea.\\n\\n\u201cI will bet something now,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cthat somewhere hereabouts are\\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\\nwould keel up before long.\u201d\\n\\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\\nattar-of-rose.\\n\\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\\nwhales in general.\\n\\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales.\\n\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty fellow, now,\u201d he banteringly laughed, standing in the\\nship\u2019s bows, \u201cthere\u2019s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes\\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\\nwill get won\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\u2019s wick into; aye, we all\\nknow these things; but look ye, here\u2019s a Crappo that is content with\\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\u2019s make him a\\npresent of a little oil for dear charity\u2019s sake. For what oil he\u2019ll get\\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldn\u2019t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I\u2019ll agree to\\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\\nthan he\u2019ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It\u2019s worth\\ntrying. Yes, I\u2019m for it;\u201d and so saying he started for the\\nquarter-deck.\\n\\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\\nStubb now called his boat\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read \u201cBouton de\\nRose,\u201d\u2014Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\\naromatic ship.\\n\\nThough Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\\nyet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.\\n\\n\u201cA wooden rose-bud, eh?\u201d he cried with his hand to his nose, \u201cthat will\\ndo very well; but how like all creation it smells!\u201d\\n\\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\\n\\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\\nbawled\u2014\u201cBouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\\nspeak English?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYes,\u201d rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\\nthe chief-mate.\\n\\n\u201cWell, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\u201d\\n\\n\u201c_What_ whale?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThe _White_ Whale\u2014a Sperm Whale\u2014Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\\n\\n\u201cNever heard of such a whale.

No!\u201d Upon which Ahab\\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\\n\\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\\nbag.\\n\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your nose, there?\u201d said Stubb. \u201cBroke it?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI wish it was broken, or that I didn\u2019t have any nose at all!\u201d answered\\nthe Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\\nmuch. \u201cBut what are you holding _yours_ for?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOh, nothing! It\u2019s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain\u2019t\\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat in the devil\u2019s name do you want here?\u201d roared the Guernseyman,\\nflying into a sudden passion.\\n\\n\u201cOh! keep cool\u2014cool? yes, that\u2019s the word! why don\u2019t you pack those\\nwhales in ice while you\u2019re working at \u2019em? But joking aside, though; do\\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it\u2019s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn\u2019t a gill in his\\nwhole carcase.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI know that well enough; but, d\u2019ye see, the Captain here won\u2019t believe\\nit; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\\ncome aboard, and mayhap he\u2019ll believe you, if he won\u2019t me; and so I\u2019ll\\nget out of this dirty scrape.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\u201d rejoined Stubb,\\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\\nconstantly filled their olfactories.","parsed":{"summary":"The Pequod encounters a French ship with two whales: one is a blasted whale that has died on the sea and is emitting a putrid smell, while the second is a whale that is almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.","excerpt_1":"Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside.","excerpt_2":"The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.

This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\\nto the Captain\u2019s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\\nindignations at times.\\n\\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter\u2019s office,\\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\\nin him during the interview.\\n\\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\\nvest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\\npolitely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\\non the aspect of interpreting between them.\\n\\n\u201cWhat shall I say to him first?\u201d said he.\\n\\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \u201cyou\\nmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\\nthough I don\u2019t pretend to be a judge.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur,\u201d said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\\ncaptain, \u201cthat only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\\nblasted whale they had brought alongside.\u201d\\n\\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\n\\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\n\\n\u201cWhy, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\\ncarefully, I\u2019m quite certain that he\u2019s no more fit to command a\\nwhale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he\u2019s a\\nbaboon.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHe vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\\nis far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures\\nus, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\u201d\\n\\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\\ncrew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\\nloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\\n\\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\\nthem.\\n\\n\u201cWhy, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that\u2014that\u2014in fact,\\ntell him I\u2019ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\\nelse.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that he\u2019s very happy to have been of any service to\\nus.\u201d\\n\\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\\n(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into\\nhis cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\\n\\n\u201cHe wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\u201d said the interpreter.\\n\\n\u201cThank him heartily; but tell him it\u2019s against my principles to drink\\nwith the man I\u2019ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that his principles won\u2019t admit of his drinking;\\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\\nhad best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\\nfor it\u2019s so calm they won\u2019t drift.\u201d\\n\\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\\nthe Guernsey-man to this effect,\u2014that having a long tow-line in his\\nboat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\\nlighter whale of the two from the ship\u2019s side. While the Frenchman\u2019s\\nboats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\\nslacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\\n\\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\\nthe Pequod slid in between him and Stubb\u2019s whale. Whereupon Stubb\\nquickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give\\nnotice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\\nunrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an\\nexcavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost\\nhave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\\nlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\\nold Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat\u2019s crew\\nwere all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\\nas anxious as gold-hunters.\\n\\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.

You might easily dent it with\\nyour thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\\ngood friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\\ndruggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\\nlost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\\nit not for impatient Ahab\u2019s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\\non board, else the ship would bid them good bye.","parsed":{"summary":"After concocting a plan with a stranger mate, Stubb successfully convinces the captain to release the whales.

Ambergris.\\n\\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\\narticle of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\\nsubject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\\nto the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\\nfor grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\\nthough at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\\ninland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\\nused in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\\npomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter\u2019s in Rome.\\nSome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\\n\\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\\nsick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\\ncause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\\ncure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\\nthree or four boat loads of Brandreth\u2019s pills, and then running out of\\nharm\u2019s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\\n\\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\\nsailors\u2019 trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\\nnothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\\n\\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\\nsaying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\\nhow that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\\ncall to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\\nbest musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\\nill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\\nthe worst.\\n\\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\\nof the Frenchman\u2019s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\\nthroughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\\nrebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\\nodious stigma originate?\\n\\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\\nthose whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\\nas the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\\nblubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\\nand carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those\\nIcy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\\nforbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\\ninto the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\\nGreenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\\nfrom excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\\nLying-in Hospital.\\n\\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\\ntimes, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\\nlatter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\\nwork on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\\n(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\\nafford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\\nout, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\\nwere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\\nall this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\\nvoyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\\noil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\\nout; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\\nThe truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\\nspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\\nrecognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\\nin the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be\\notherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high\\nhealth; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it\\nis true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm\\nWhale\u2019s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\\nlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\\nSperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?

The Castaway.\\n\\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod\u2019s crew;\\nan event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes\\nmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying\\nprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\\n\\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.\\nSome few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is\\nto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general\\nthing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising\\nthe boats\u2019 crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,\\nor timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a\\nship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by\\nnick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;\\nye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\\ngloomy-jolly.\\n\\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and\\na white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven\\nin one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull\\nand torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at\\nbottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness\\npeculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and\\nfestivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,\\nthe year\u2019s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five\\nFourth of Julys and New Year\u2019s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that\\nthis little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\\nbehold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king\u2019s cabinets. But Pip loved\\nlife, and all life\u2019s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking\\nbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had\\nmost sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,\\nwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be\\nluridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him\\noff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland\\nCounty in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler\u2019s frolic on\\nthe green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\\npure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\\njeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\\nlays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,\\nbut by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,\\ninfernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\\nsymbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from\\nthe King of Hell. But let us to the story.\\n\\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\u2019s after-oarsman\\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\\nand, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\\n\\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\\nbut happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\\nhim, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\\nto the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\\n\\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\\nthe fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\\nhappened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip\u2019s seat. The\\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\\nline coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\\nto become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\\ninstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\\nstraightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\\nthe boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\\nseveral turns around his chest and neck.\\n\\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\\nhated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\\nsuspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\\nexclaimed interrogatively, \u201cCut?\u201d Meantime Pip\u2019s blue, choked face\\nplainly looked, Do, for God\u2019s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\\nhalf a minute, this entire thing happened.\\n\\n\u201cDamn him, cut!\u201d roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\\nsaved.\\n\\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\\nyells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\\nirregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\\nbut still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\\nunofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\\njump from a boat, Pip, except\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the\\nsoundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\\ntrue motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\\nthe boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\\nhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\\ndropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \u201cStick to\\nthe boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won\u2019t pick you up if you jump; mind\\nthat. We can\u2019t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\\nsell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\\nmind, and don\u2019t jump any more.\u201d Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\\nthat though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\\nwhich propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\\n\\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\\nunder very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\\ntime he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\\nto run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller\u2019s\\ntrunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\\nbounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\\nstretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater\u2019s skin\\nhammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip\u2019s\\nebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\\nhe fell so rapidly astern. Stubb\u2019s inexorable back was turned upon him;\\nand the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\\nocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\\nPip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\\ncastaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\\n\\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\\nlonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\\nmiddle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\\nhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea\u2014mark how closely\\nthey hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\\n\\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\\nhe did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\\nand he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\\nvery quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\\ntowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\\nmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\\nnot unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\\ncalled, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\\nmilitary navies and armies.","parsed":{"summary":"After a ship-keeper\'s injury, Pip is temporarily put in his place on a whale hunt.

A Squeeze of the Hand.\\n\\nThat whale of Stubb\u2019s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\\nPequod\u2019s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\\npreviously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of\\nthe Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\n\\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\\ndragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and\\nwhen the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated\\nere going to the try-works, of which anon.\\n\\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\\nseveral others, I sat down before a large Constantine\u2019s bath of it, I\\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about\\nin the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back\\ninto fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this\\nsperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!\\nsuch a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it\\nfor only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it\\nwere, to serpentine and spiralise.\\n\\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\\nexertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\\nindolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands\\namong those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost\\nwithin the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all\\ntheir opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\\nuncontaminated aroma,\u2014literally and truly, like the smell of spring\\nviolets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\\nmeadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\\nsperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\\nthe old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\\nallaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely\\nfree from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\\ntill I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\\nstrange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly\\nsqueezing my co-laborers\u2019 hands in it, mistaking their hands for the\\ngentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\\nfeeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\\nsqueezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as\\nmuch as to say,\u2014Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish\\nany social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;\\nlet us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\\nsperm of kindness.\\n\\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since\\nby many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all\\ncases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of\\nattainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\\nfancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the\\nfireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready\\nto squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I\\nsaw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\\nspermaceti.\\n\\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\\nakin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\\ntry-works.\\n\\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\\npart of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\\nis tough with congealed tendons\u2014a wad of muscle\u2014but still contains some\\noil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\\ninto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\\nblocks of Berkshire marble.\\n\\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\\nwhale\u2019s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\\na most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\\nimports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\\nsnowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\\npurple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\\nit is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\\nstole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should\\nconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have\\ntasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the\\nvenison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\\n\\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\\nthe course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\\nadequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\\noriginal with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\\nIt is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\\ntubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I\\nhold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,\\ncoalescing.\\n\\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\\ndark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\\nGreenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those\\ninferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\\n\\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\u2019s\\nvocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\u2019s\\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\\npart of Leviathan\u2019s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the\\nrest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along\\nthe oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless\\nblandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.\\n\\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\\nonce to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its\\ninmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for\\nthe blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the\\nproper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a\\nscene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by\\na dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They\\ngenerally go in pairs,\u2014a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The\\nwhaling-pike is similar to a frigate\u2019s boarding-weapon of the same\\nname. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the\\ngaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from\\nslipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the\\nspade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into\\nthe portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the\\nspademan\u2019s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes\\nirresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of\\nhis own toes, or one of his assistants\u2019, would you be very much\\nastonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.","parsed":{"summary":"The crew works to cut and hoist a whale, bale oil, and prepare the sperm whale for the try-works.

The Try-Works.\\n\\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\\ndistinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the\\nmost solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\\ncompleted ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\\ntransported to her planks.\\n\\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\\nroomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\\nfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\\nmortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The\\nfoundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\\nsides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\\nhatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\\nnumber, and each of several barrels\u2019 capacity. When not in use, they\\nare kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\\nand sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\\nnight-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\\nthemselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them\u2014one\\nman in each pot, side by side\u2014many confidential communications are\\ncarried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\\nmathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,\\nwith the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies\\ngliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\\nany point in precisely the same time.\\n\\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\\nthe furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted\\nwith heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented\\nfrom communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\\nextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\\ninserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\\nfast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\\nfrom the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.\\n\\nIt was about nine o\u2019clock at night that the Pequod\u2019s try-works were\\nfirst started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee\\nthe business.\\n\\n\u201cAll ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\\nworks.\u201d This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\\nthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\\nfor a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\\nquick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\\nthe crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still\\ncontains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed\\nthe flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\\nhis own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\\nhorrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you\\nmust live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor\\nabout it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells\\nlike the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the\\npit.\\n\\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\\ncarcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\\ndarkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\\nflames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\\nfire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\\nsome vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\\nbold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad\\nsheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and\\nfolded them in conflagrations.\\n\\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\\nhearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of\\nthe pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship\u2019s stokers. With huge\\npronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding\\npots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,\\ncurling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled\\naway in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\\nthe boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.\\nOpposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden\\nhearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the\\nwatch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the\\nfire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny\\nfeatures, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,\\nand the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were\\nstrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they\\nnarrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror\\ntold in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\\nout of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their\\nfront, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\\nforks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the\\nship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\\nand further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\\nall sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\\nwith fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\\ndarkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander\u2019s\\nsoul.\\n\\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\\nguided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that\\ninterval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the\\nmadness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend\\nshapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at\\nlast begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to\\nthat unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a\\nmidnight helm.\\n\\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\\nthing occurred to me.

The jaw-bone tiller\\nsmote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of\\nsails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\\nopen; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\\nmechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\\nthis, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\\nbut a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\\nlamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\\nthen made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\\nthat whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\\nany haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\\nfeeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the\\ntiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in\\nsome enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?\\nthought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was\\nfronting the ship\u2019s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\\nan instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying\\nup into the wind, and very probably capsizing her.

Stowing Down and Clearing Up.\\n\\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\\nand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\\nalongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\\nheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\\ngreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\\ndue time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and\\nAbednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\\nfire;\u2014but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of\\nthe description by rehearsing\u2014singing, if I may\u2014the romantic proceeding\\nof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the\\nhold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,\\nsliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to\\nrise and blow.\\n\\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,\\nevery sailor is a cooper.\\n\\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\\nand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the\\nhatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\\n\\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\\nmasses of the whale\u2019s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted\\nall the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the\\nentire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din\\nis deafening.\\n\\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\\npossesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\\ndecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\\noil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\\npotent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\\nof the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly\\nexterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot\\nis brushed from the lower rigging.

The Doubloon.\\n\\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\\ntaking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in\\nthe multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\\nadded how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,\\nhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely\\neyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the\\nbinnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\\ncompass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\\nhis purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\\ngold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only\\ndashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\\n\\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\\ncertain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\\nworth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell\\nby the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass\\nin the Milky Way.\\n\\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of\\nthe heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,\\nthe head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst\\nall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,\\nyet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\\nQuito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\\npassed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with\\nthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless\\nevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it\\nwas set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\\nwanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as\\nthe white whale\u2019s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary\\nwatch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he\\nwould ever live to spend it.\\n\\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\\nand tropic token-pieces.

On its round border it bore the letters,\\nREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country\\nplanted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and\\nnamed after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the\\nunwaning clime that knows no autumn.

Leg and Arm.\\n\\nThe Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.\\n\\n\u201cShip, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?\u201d\\n\\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\\nbearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\\nthe stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat\u2019s\\nbow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\\nsixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\\nhim in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar\u2019s surcoat.\\n\\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSee you this?\u201d and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,\\nhe held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\\nhead like a mallet.\\n\\n\u201cMan my boat!\u201d cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\\nhim\u2014\u201cStand by to lower!\u201d\\n\\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\\nown, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\\ncontrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\\nshipped in any other vessel at a moment\u2019s warning. Now, it is no very\\neasy matter for anybody\u2014except those who are almost hourly used to it,\\nlike whalemen\u2014to clamber up a ship\u2019s side from a boat on the open sea;\\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\\ndeprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\\nunsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\\n\\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\\ncried out, \u201cI see, I see!\u2014avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\\nover the cutting-tackle.\u201d\\n\\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\\nThis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\\nin the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\\ngiving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\\nhoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\\nparts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\\nbulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\\nputting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\\nsword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \u201cAye, aye, hearty! let\\nus shake bones together!\u2014an arm and a leg!\u2014an arm that never can\\nshrink, d\u2019ye see; and a leg that never can run.

Seeing how matters\\nstood, and what a noble great whale it was\u2014the noblest and biggest I\\never saw, sir, in my life\u2014I resolved to capture him, spite of the\\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\\ndevil of a boat\u2019s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\\nsay, I jumped into my first mate\u2019s boat\u2014Mr. Mounttop\u2019s here (by the\\nway, Captain\u2014Mounttop; Mounttop\u2014the captain);\u2014as I was saying, I jumped\\ninto Mounttop\u2019s boat, which, d\u2019ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\\ngreat-grandfather have it.

We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\\nto that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\\nthe same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\\nlike a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\\nme caught me here\u201d (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \u201cyes,\\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell\u2019s flames, I was\\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\\nript its way along the flesh\u2014clear along the whole length of my\\narm\u2014came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;\u2014and that gentleman there\\nwill tell you the rest (by the way, captain\u2014Dr. Bunger, ship\u2019s surgeon:\\nBunger, my lad,\u2014the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\\nyarn.\u201d\\n\\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\\nthe time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\\nhis gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but\\nsober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\\npatched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between\\na marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\\noccasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\\ncrippled captains. But, at his superior\u2019s introduction of him to Ahab,\\nhe politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain\u2019s bidding.\\n\\n\u201cIt was a shocking bad wound,\u201d began the whale-surgeon; \u201cand, taking my\\nadvice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy\u2014\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSamuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\u201d interrupted the one-armed\\ncaptain, addressing Ahab; \u201cgo on, boy.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cStood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing\\nhot weather there on the Line.

Oh, ye stars! he sat up\\nwith me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,\\nand very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh\\nout! why don\u2019t ye? You know you\u2019re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave\\nahead, boy, I\u2019d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other\\nman.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMy captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir\u201d\u2014said the\\nimperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab\u2014\u201cis apt to\\nbe facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But\\nI may as well say\u2014en passant, as the French remark\u2014that I myself\u2014that\\nis to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy\u2014am a strict total\\nabstinence man; I never drink\u2014\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWater!\u201d cried the captain; \u201che never drinks it; it\u2019s a sort of fits to\\nhim; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on\u2014go on with\\nthe arm story.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYes, I may as well,\u201d said the surgeon, coolly. \u201cI was about observing,\\nsir, before Captain Boomer\u2019s facetious interruption, that spite of my\\nbest and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;\\nthe truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\\nmore than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead\\nline. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it\\ncame. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\\nagainst all rule\u201d\u2014pointing at it with the marlingspike\u2014\u201cthat is the\\ncaptain\u2019s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\\nthat club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one\u2019s brains out\\nwith, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\\npassions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir\u201d\u2014removing his hat, and\\nbrushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\\nbut which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever\\nhaving been a wound\u2014\u201cWell, the captain there will tell you how that\\ncame here; he knows.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbut his mother did; he was born with\\nit. Oh, you solemn rogue, you\u2014you Bunger! was there ever such another\\nBunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\\npickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat became of the White Whale?\u201d now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\\nimpatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.\\n\\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried the one-armed captain, \u201coh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\\ndidn\u2019t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\\ndidn\u2019t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\\nMoby Dick\u2014as some call him\u2014and then I knew it was he.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDid\u2019st thou cross his wake again?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cTwice.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBut could not fasten?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to try to: ain\u2019t one limb enough? What should I do without\\nthis other arm? And I\u2019m thinking Moby Dick doesn\u2019t bite so much as he\\nswallows.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d interrupted Bunger, \u201cgive him your left arm for bait to\\nget the right. Do you know, gentlemen\u201d\u2014very gravely and mathematically\\nbowing to each Captain in succession\u2014\u201cDo you know, gentlemen, that the\\ndigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\\nProvidence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\\neven a man\u2019s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\\nWhite Whale\u2019s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\\nswallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\\nmine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\\ntwelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\\nsmall tacks, d\u2019ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\\njack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\\nYes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\\nto the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\\nhave another chance at you shortly, that\u2019s all.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cNo, thank ye, Bunger,\u201d said the English Captain, \u201che\u2019s welcome to the\\narm he has, since I can\u2019t help it, and didn\u2019t know him then; but not to\\nanother one. No more White Whales for me; I\u2019ve lowered for him once,\\nand that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I\\nknow that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark\\nye, he\u2019s best let alone; don\u2019t you think so, Captain?\u201d\u2014glancing at the\\nivory leg.\\n\\n\u201cHe is.

The Decanter.\\n\\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\\nhailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\\nmerchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\\nEnderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not\\nfar behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point\\nof real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord\\n1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\\nthe first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.\\n\\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\\nthe Amelia\u2019s example was soon followed by other ships, English and\\nAmerican, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\\nthrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons\u2014how many, their\\nmother only knows\u2014and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\\nof their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\\nThat ship\u2014well called the \u201cSyren\u201d\u2014made a noble experimental cruise; and\\nit was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\\nCaptain Coffin, a Nantucketer.\\n\\nAll honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to\\nthe present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago\\nhave slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.\\n\\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast\\nsailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps\u2014every\\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\\ngam I had\u2014long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\\nivory heel\u2014it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\\nlose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\\nat the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it\u2019s\\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all hands\u2014visitors and all\u2014were\\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\\nother aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\\njackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\\nhowling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\\nwe had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\\nmy taste.\\n\\nThe beef was fine\u2014tough, but with body in it. They said it was\\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\\nyou could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\\nswallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their\\npitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread\u2014but that couldn\u2019t be\\nhelped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\\nlight, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\\nate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the\\ndimensions of the cook\u2019s boilers, including his own live parchment\\nboilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of\\ngood fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and\\ncapital from boot heels to hat-band.\\n\\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\\nEnglish whalers I know of\u2014not all though\u2014were such famous, hospitable\\nships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\\njoke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\\nwill tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is\\nmatter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\\nhistorical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\\n\\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching\\nplenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,\\nin the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\\nnatural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\\nspecial origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\\nelucidated.\\n\\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\\nmust be about whalers. The title was, \u201cDan Coopman,\u201d wherefore I\\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\\n\u201cFitz Swackhammer.\u201d But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\\nprofessor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus\\nand St. Pott\u2019s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\\nbox of sperm candles for his trouble\u2014this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\\nhe spied the book, assured me that \u201cDan Coopman\u201d did not mean \u201cThe\\nCooper,\u201d but \u201cThe Merchant.\u201d In short, this ancient and learned Low\\nDutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\\nsubjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\\nAnd in this chapter it was, headed, \u201cSmeer,\u201d or \u201cFat,\u201d that I found a\\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\\nsail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,\\nI transcribe the following:\\n\\n400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\\nfish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\\nof butter. 20,000 lbs.

In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\\ntrain oil.\\n\\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\\nclimate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\\nincluding the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\\nmuch exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\\nfleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\\nsay, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks\u2019\\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\\nNow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\\nfancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\\nboat\u2019s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\\nsomewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\\nthis was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\\nthe constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\\nboat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\\n\\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example.

A Bower in the Arsacides.\\n\\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\\ndwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\\nupon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\\nsweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\\nfurther, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,\\nand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost\\nbones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his\\nunconditional skeleton.\\n\\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\\nwhale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures\\non the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\\nspecimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a\\nfull-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a\\nroast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,\\nIshmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;\\nthe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\\nridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\\ncheeseries in his bowels.\\n\\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed\\nwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged\\nto, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\\npoke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the\\nheads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my\\nboat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the\\ncontents of that young cub?\\n\\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\\ngigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted\\nto my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.\\nFor being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey\\nof Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with\\nthe lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side\\nglen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his\\ncapital.\\n\\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\\nwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought\\ntogether in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\\npeople could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,\\nchiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and\\nall these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\\nwonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\\n\\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\\nunusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\\nhead against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings\\nseemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of\\nits fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\\nthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where\\na grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.\\n\\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebr\xe6 were carved with\\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again\\nsent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the\\nterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung\\nsword that so affrighted Damocles.\\n\\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;\\nthe trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weaver\u2019s loom, with a gorgeous\\ncarpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and\\nwoof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their\\nladen branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\\nmessage-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the\\nlacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\\nthe unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!\u2014pause!\u2014one\\nword!\u2014whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all\\nthese ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!\u2014stay thy hand!\u2014but one single\\nword with thee! Nay\u2014the shuttle flies\u2014the figures float from forth the\\nloom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,\\nhe weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal\\nvoice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;\\nand only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\\nthrough it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken\\nwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words\\nare plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened\\ncasements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be\\nheedful; for so, in all this din of the great world\u2019s loom, thy\\nsubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.\\n\\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\\ngreat, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging\u2014a gigantic idler! Yet,\\nas the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\\nhim, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over\\nwith the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\\nhimself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim\\ngod wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.\\n\\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\\nskull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\\njet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an\\nobject of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\\nshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\\nbefore this skeleton\u2014brushed the vines aside\u2014broke through the ribs\u2014and\\nwith a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many\\nwinding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and\\nfollowing it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no\\nliving thing within; naught was there but bones.\\n\\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\\nskeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me\\ntaking the altitude of the final rib, \u201cHow now!\u201d they shouted; \u201cDar\u2019st\\nthou measure this our god! That\u2019s for us.\u201d \u201cAye, priests\u2014well, how long\\ndo ye make him, then?\u201d But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,\\nconcerning feet and inches; they cracked each other\u2019s sconces with\\ntheir yard-sticks\u2014the great skull echoed\u2014and seizing that lucky chance,\\nI quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\\n\\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\\nrecorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\\nmeasurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\\nrefer to, to test my accuracy.

Measurement of The Whale\u2019s Skeleton.\\n\\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\\nstatement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\\nwe are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\\n\\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\\nupon Captain Scoresby\u2019s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\\nGreenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\\ncalculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\\neighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\\nfeet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\\nninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\\nconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\\nthousand one hundred inhabitants.\\n\\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\\nthis leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\u2019s imagination?\\n\\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\\njaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\\nunobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\\nproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\\nmost complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\\nin this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\\nyour arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\\nof the general structure we are about to view.\\n\\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\\nfeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\\nfifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\\nfeet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\\nthan a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\\nwhich once enclosed his vitals.\\n\\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\\nfor the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\\n\\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\\na seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\\narched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\\nfootpath bridges over small streams.\\n\\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\\nthe Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\\nfish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\\nthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\\nsixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\\nthan eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\\nof the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\\nnow saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\\ntons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\\nthe ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\\nthe weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\\n\\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\\ndead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\\nthe heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\\nangry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\\ninvested whale be truly and livingly found out.\\n\\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\\nit\u2019s done, it looks much like Pompey\u2019s Pillar.\\n\\nThere are forty and odd vertebr\xe6 in all, which in the skeleton are not\\nlocked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\\nGothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\\nmiddle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\\nmore than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\\ntail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\\nbilliard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest\u2019s children,\\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\\nsimple child\u2019s play.","parsed":{"summary":"The author provides a description of the size and structure of a Sperm Whale, specifically its massive skeleton and ribs.

The Fossil Whale.\\n\\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and\\nthe yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\\ninvolutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables\\nand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a\\nline-of-battle-ship.\\n\\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to\\napprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels.

Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and\\nliberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\\nmust choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be\\nwritten on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.\\n\\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I\\nhave been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and\\nwells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by\\nway of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the\\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\\nalmost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are\\ncalled the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose\\nremote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil\\nWhales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the\\nlast preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet\\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking\\nrank as Cetacean fossils.\\n\\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\\nand skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,\\nbeen found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,\\nin Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\\nAmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the\\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street\\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon\u2019s\\ntime. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\\nutterly unknown Leviathanic species.\\n\\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,\\non the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken\\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\\nfallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and\\nbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of\\nit being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned\\nout that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again\\nrepeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\\nlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen\\nrechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the\\nLondon Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most\\nextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted\\nout of existence.\\n\\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,\\njaws, ribs, and vertebr\xe6, all characterized by partial resemblances to\\nthe existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on\\nthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\\nLeviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to\\nthat wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for\\ntime began with man. Here Saturn\u2019s grey chaos rolls over me, and I\\nobtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when\\nwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and\\nin all the 25,000 miles of this world\u2019s circumference, not an\\ninhabitable hand\u2019s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world\\nwas the whale\u2019s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the\\npresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree\\nlike Leviathan? Ahab\u2019s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh\u2019s.\\nMethuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I\\nam horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the\\nunspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,\\nmust needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\n\\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\\nancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim\\nfor them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable\\nprint of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some\\nfifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a\\nsculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,\\nand dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe\\nof the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was\\nthere swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was\\ncradled.\\n\\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity\\nof the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by\\nthe venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.","parsed":{"summary":"The narrator, having already described the whale in present anatomical peculiarities, now proceeds to magnify him in an archeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.

Does the Whale\u2019s Magnitude Diminish?\u2014Will He Perish?\\n\\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\\nthe head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,\\nin the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the\\noriginal bulk of his sires.\\n\\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\\nfound in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\\nprior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\\nones.\\n\\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\\nAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,\\nthat the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a\\nlarge sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen\u2019s authority,\\nthat Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the\\ntime of capture.\\n\\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\\nadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may\\nit not be, that since Adam\u2019s time they have degenerated?\\n\\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of\\nsuch gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For\\nPliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\\nAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length\u2014Rope\\nWalks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and\\nSolander, Cooke\u2019s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy\\nof Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or\\nWrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three\\nhundred and sixty feet. And Lac\xe9p\xe8de, the French naturalist, in his\\nelaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page\\n3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and\\ntwenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\\n\\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is\\nas big as his ancestors in Pliny\u2019s time. And if ever I go where Pliny\\nis, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.\\nBecause I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies\\nthat were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not\\nmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;\\nand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest\\nEgyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they\\nare drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize\\ncattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the\\nfattest of Pharaoh\u2019s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not\\nadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.\\n\\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient\\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even\\nthrough Behring\u2019s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\\nlockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\\nall continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long\\nendure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\\nat last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the\\nlast man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final\\npuff.\\n\\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the\\nprairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and\\nscowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous\\nriver-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar\\nan inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem\\nfurnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy\\nextinction.\\n\\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\\nperiod ago\u2014not a good lifetime\u2014the census of the buffalo in Illinois\\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\\ndifferent nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious\\nan end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales\\nfor forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank\\nGod, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the\\ndays of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,\\nwhen the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness\\nand a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain\\nnot forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need\\nwere, could be statistically stated.\\n\\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\\nyears (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\\nremunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\\ninfluenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\\ncaravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,\\nand pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\\nwidely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone\\nwhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\\nthem, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being\\ndriven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened\\nwith their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been\\nvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.\\n\\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\\nfirm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\\nimpregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty\\nSwiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas\\nand glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort\\nto their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\\nand walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed\\ncircle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.\\n\\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.\\nBut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than\\n13,000, have been annually slain on the nor\u2019 west coast by the\\nAmericans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\\nmatter.\\n\\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to\\nHarto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the\\nKing of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems\\nno reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted\\nfor thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all\\nthe successive monarchs of the East\u2014if they still survive there in\\ngreat numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since\\nhe has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as\\nall Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the\\nIsles of the sea combined.","parsed":{"summary":"The passage debates whether or not the size of the whale is diminishing or if they are still as large as they were in Pliny\'s time.

Ahab\u2019s Leg.\\n\\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\\nhis own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\\nboat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when\\nafter gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\\nwas, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);\\nthen, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances\\nlusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\\nbeen very long prior to the Pequod\u2019s sailing from Nantucket, that he\\nhad been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;\\nby some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\\nivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise\\nsmitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme\\ndifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\\n\\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all\\nthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of\\na former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most\\npoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as\\nthe sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,\\nall miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than\\nequally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief\\ngo further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of\\nthis: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them\\nfor the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\\njoy-childlessness of all hell\u2019s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal\\nmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\\nprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of\\nthis, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\\nthing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities\\never have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\\nbottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an\\narchangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the\\nobvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\\nmiseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\\ngods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\\ncymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that\\nthe gods themselves are not for ever glad.

The Carpenter.\\n\\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\\nfrom the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\\nBut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\\nthe high, humane abstraction; the Pequod\u2019s carpenter was no duplicate;\\nhence, he now comes in person on this stage.\\n\\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\\nto whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\\nown; the carpenter\u2019s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\\nof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\\nwood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\\nthe generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\\nrecurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years\u2019 voyage, in\\nuncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\\nordinary duties:\u2014repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull\u2019s eyes in the deck, or new\\ntree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\\ndirectly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\\nuseful and capricious.\\n\\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\\nwas his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\\nvices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\\nexcept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\\nathwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\\n\\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\\nthe carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\\nstraightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\\nmakes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\\ncarpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\\nto be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\\nbig vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\\nbut the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\\noperation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\\n\\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\\nand without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\\ndeemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\\nsuch liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\\nsome uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\\nnothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\\nstolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\\nsurrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\\nstolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\\nand ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\\nthis half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\\nall-ramifying heartlessness;\u2014yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\\nold, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked\\nnow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\\nserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\\nforecastle of Noah\u2019s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a\\nlife-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had\\ngathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\\nstript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\\nbabe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\\nYou might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\\ninvolved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\\nnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\\nhad been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\\nprocess. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.

So, it\\nbeing calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the\\nslumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight\\nsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they\\ngo; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost\\npuncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone\\ncask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted\\nplacards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.\\nTierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of\\nstaves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the\\npiled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under\\nfoot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and\\nrolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the\\nship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was\\nit that the Typhoons did not visit them then.\\n\\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\\nbosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh\\nto his endless end.\\n\\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\\ndignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\\nhigher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as\\nharpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but\u2014as\\nwe have elsewhere seen\u2014mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and\\nfinally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all\\nday in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the\\nclumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,\\nthe harpooneers are the holders, so called.\\n\\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\\nhave stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,\\nstripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about\\namid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom\\nof a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\\npagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\\ncaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\\nsome days\u2019 suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill\\nof the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few\\nlong-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\\nframe and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his\\ncheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller\\nand fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but\\ndeeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony\\nto that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And\\nlike circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his\\neyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe\\nthat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of\\nthis waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly\\nwondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And\\nthe drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all\\nwith a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could\\nadequately tell. So that\u2014let us say it again\u2014no dying Chaldee or Greek\\nhad higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you\\nsaw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his\\nswaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his\\nfinal rest, and the ocean\u2019s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and\\nhigher towards his destined heaven.\\n\\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\\nasked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was\\njust breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had\\nchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich\\nwar-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all\\nwhalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,\\nand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was\\nnot unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead\\nwarrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\\naway to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the\\nstars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own\\nmild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form\\nthe white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the\\nthought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\\nsea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\\nNo: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\\nto him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes\\nwere without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and\\nmuch lee-way adown the dim ages.\\n\\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\\nwas at once commanded to do Queequeg\u2019s bidding, whatever it might\\ninclude.

The Blacksmith.\\n\\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in\\nthese latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits\\nshortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old\\nblacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after\\nconcluding his contributory work for Ahab\u2019s leg, but still retained it\\non deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost\\nincessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do\\nsome little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their\\nvarious weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an\\neager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,\\npike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every\\nsooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man\u2019s was a\\npatient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no\\npetulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over\\nstill further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil\\nwere life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating\\nof his heart. And so it was.\u2014Most miserable!\\n\\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing\\nyawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the\\ncuriosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\\nquestionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\\none now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.\\n\\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter\u2019s midnight, on the road\\nrunning between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt\\nthe deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,\\ndilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both\\nfeet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four\\nacts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied\\nfifth act of the grief of his life\u2019s drama.\\n\\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\\nencountered that thing in sorrow\u2019s technicals called ruin. He had been\\nan artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house\\nand garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three\\nblithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,\\nplanted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further\\nconcealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into\\nhis happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\\ntell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into\\nhis family\u2019s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,\\nfor prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith\u2019s shop was\\nin the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so\\nthat always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\\nunhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing\\nof her young-armed old husband\u2019s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled\\nby passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,\\nin her nursery; and so, to stout Labor\u2019s iron lullaby, the blacksmith\u2019s\\ninfants were rocked to slumber.\\n\\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?\\nHadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came\\nupon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her\\norphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after\\nyears; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked\\ndown some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely\\nhung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than\\nuseless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him\\neasier to harvest.\\n\\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew\\nmore and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the\\nlast; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,\\nglitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows\\nfell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother\\ndived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed\\nher thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a\\nvagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to\\nflaxen curls!\\n\\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death\\nis only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but\\nthe first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the\\nWild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of\\nsuch men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions\\nagainst suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean\\nalluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking\\nterrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of\\ninfinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them\u2014\u201cCome hither,\\nbroken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate\\ndeath; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them.

Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\\nand these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain\u2019s and\\nofficers\u2019 state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\\ninto kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\\nforecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\\nand filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\\nhead on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\\nhis spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\\nsockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\\nfilled with sperm, except the captain\u2019s pantaloons pockets, and those\\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\\nhis entire satisfaction.\\n\\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\\nof the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\\nclenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\\nIsland negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\\npresiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship\u2019s\\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\\nwhich the huge pots had been removed.

But\\nnever mind; it\u2019s all in fun: so the old song says;\u201d\u2014(_sings_.)\\n\\n\\n  Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A\u2019 flourishin\u2019 his\\n  tail,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\\n  Ocean, oh!\\n\\n  The scud all a flyin\u2019, That\u2019s his flip only foamin\u2019; When he stirs in\\n  the spicin\u2019,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\\n  is the Ocean, oh!\\n\\n  Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin\u2019 of\\n  this flip,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\\n  is the Ocean, oh!\\n\\n\\n\\n\u201cAvast Stubb,\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201clet the Typhoon sing, and strike his\\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\\nthy peace.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBut I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\\nStarbuck, there\u2019s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\\nthroat. And when that\u2019s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\\nwind-up.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMadman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\\nmind how foolish?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\\nhand towards the weather bow, \u201cmarkest thou not that the gale comes\\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand\u2014his\\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\\nmust!\\n\\n\u201cI don\u2019t half understand ye: what\u2019s in the wind?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\\nNantucket,\u201d soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\u2019s\\nquestion. \u201cThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward\u2014I see it lightens up\\nthere; but not with the lightning.\u201d\\n\\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\\n\\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOld Thunder!\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\\nlances of fire.\\n\\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\\nvessel\u2019s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\\nship\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\\n\\n\u201cThe rods! the rods!\u201d cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. \u201cAre they overboard? drop them\\nover, fore and aft. Quick!\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Ahab; \u201clet\u2019s have fair play here, though we be the\\nweaker side. Yet I\u2019ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!

What\u2019s the mighty difference between holding a mast\u2019s\\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn\u2019t\\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm?

Best spill it?\u2014wait. I\u2019ll\\ncure myself of this. I\u2019ll hold the musket boldly while I think.\u2014I come\\nto report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and\\ndoom,\u2014_that\u2019s_ fair for Moby Dick.

Does he not say\\nhe will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his\\nheavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his\\nway by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very\\nTyphoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But\\nshall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship\u2019s\\ncompany down to doom with him?\u2014Yes, it would make him the wilful\\nmurderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;\\nand come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have\\nhis way. If, then, he were this instant\u2014put aside, that crime would not\\nbe his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,\u2014in there,\\nhe\u2019s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I\\ncan\u2019t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;\\nnot entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat\\nobedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,\\nand say\u2019st the men have vow\u2019d thy vow; say\u2019st all of us are Ahabs.\\nGreat God forbid!\u2014But is there no other way? no lawful way?\u2014Make him a\\nprisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man\u2019s living\\npower from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were\\npinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to\\nring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged\\ntiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his\\nhowlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me\\non the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is\\nhundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone\\nhere upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me\\nand law.\u2014Aye, aye, \u2019tis so.\u2014Is heaven a murderer when its lightning\\nstrikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin\\ntogether?\u2014And would I be a murderer, then, if\u201d\u2014and slowly, stealthily,\\nand half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket\u2019s end against\\nthe door.\\n\\n\u201cOn this level, Ahab\u2019s hammock swings within; his head this way.

The Needle.\\n\\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of\\nmighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod\u2019s gurgling track, pushed her on\\nlike giants\u2019 palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded\\nso, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world\\nboomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the\\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;\\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\\n\\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to\\neye the bright sun\u2019s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\\nsettled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun\u2019s rearward\\nplace, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\\nwake.\\n\\n\u201cHa, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot\\nof the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to\\nye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!\u201d\\n\\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards\\nthe helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\n\\n\u201cEast-sou-east, sir,\u201d said the frightened steersman.\\n\\n\u201cThou liest!\u201d smiting him with his clenched fist. \u201cHeading East at this\\nhour in the morning, and the sun astern?\u201d\\n\\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then\\nobserved by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very\\nblinding palpableness must have been the cause.\\n\\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse\\nof the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost\\nseemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\\ncompasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\\n\\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, \u201cI have it! It has happened\\nbefore. Mr. Starbuck, last night\u2019s thunder turned our compasses\u2014that\u2019s\\nall. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,\u201d said the pale mate,\\ngloomily.\\n\\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\\none case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\\ndeveloped in the mariner\u2019s needle, is, as all know, essentially one\\nwith the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\\nmarvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\\nhas actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\\nand rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\\nfatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife\u2019s knitting needle.\\nBut in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\\naffected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.\\n\\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took\\nthe precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were\\nexactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\u2019s course to be\\nchanged accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\\none had only been juggling her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\\nFlask\u2014who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\\nfeelings\u2014likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\\nof Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\\nwholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab\u2019s.\\n\\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.\\n\\n\u201cThou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun\u2019s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But\\nAhab is lord over the level loadstone yet.

Besides, the old\\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\\nsailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.\\n\\n\u201cMen,\u201d said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him\\nthe things he had demanded, \u201cmy men, the thunder turned old Ahab\u2019s\\nneedles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,\\nthat will point as true as any.\u201d\\n\\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\\nthis was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\\nmight follow. But Starbuck looked away.\\n\\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\\nlance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\\nhim hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the\\nmaul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\\nhammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.\\nThen going through some small strange motions with it\u2014whether\\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\\naugment the awe of the crew, is uncertain\u2014he called for linen thread;\\nand moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\\nand horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of\\nthe compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering\\nand vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when\\nAhab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\\nback from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\\nexclaimed,\u2014\u201cLook ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level\\nloadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!\u201d\\n\\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could\\npersuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk\\naway.\\n\\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his\\nfatal pride.","parsed":{"summary":"Ahab discovers that the ship\'s compasses have been turned by a thunderstorm, and he takes it upon himself to magnetize a new one.

The Log and Line.\\n\\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\\nand line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\\nupon other means of determining the vessel\u2019s place, some merchantmen,\\nand many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave\\nthe log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form\u2019s sake\\nthan anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the\\ncourse steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of\\nprogression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden\\nreel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the\\nrailing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and\\nwind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet\\nscene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his\\nfrantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing\\nplungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.\\n\\n\u201cForward, there! Heave the log!\u201d\\n\\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.\\n\u201cTake the reel, one of ye, I\u2019ll heave.\u201d\\n\\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship\u2019s lee side, where the\\ndeck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into\\nthe creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\\n\\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so\\nstood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to\\nhim.\\n\\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\\nturns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old\\nManxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to\\nspeak.\\n\\n\u201cSir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\\nspoiled it.\u201d\\n\\n\u201c\u2019Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?\\nThou seem\u2019st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says.

Where wert\\nthou born?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIn the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cExcellent! Thou\u2019st hit the world by that.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI know not, sir, but I was born there.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIn the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it\u2019s good.

The dead, blind wall\\nbutts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.\u201d\\n\\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\\ndragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\\nturn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\\nresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\\n\\n\u201cHold hard!\u201d\\n\\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\\ntugging log was gone.\\n\\n\u201cI crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\\nsea parts the log-line.

The Life-Buoy.\\n\\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab\u2019s levelled steel, and her progress\\nsolely determined by Ahab\u2019s level log and line; the Pequod held on her\\npath towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\\nunfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways\\nimpelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all\\nthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\\ndesperate scene.\\n\\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before\\nthe dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch\u2014then\\nheaded by Flask\u2014was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\nunearthly\u2014like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod\u2019s\\nmurdered Innocents\u2014that one and all, they started from their reveries,\\nand for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild\\ncry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the\\ncrew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers\\nremained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman\u2014the oldest mariner of\\nall\u2014declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the\\nvoices of newly drowned men in the sea.\\n\\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he\\ncame to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not\\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus\\nexplained the wonder.\\n\\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\\nnumbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or\\nsome dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and\\nkept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of\\nwail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most\\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not\\nonly from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\\nhuman look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain\\ncircumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.\\n\\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\\nwith the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had\\nnot been long at his perch, when a cry was heard\u2014a cry and a\\nrushing\u2014and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\\nsea.\\n\\nThe life-buoy\u2014a long slender cask\u2014was dropped from the stern, where it\\nalways hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,\\nand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it\\nslowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and\\nthe studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to\\nyield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.\\n\\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out\\nfor the White Whale, on the White Whale\u2019s own peculiar ground; that man\\nwas swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the\\ntime. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at\\nleast as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of\\nevil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.\\nThey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they\\nhad heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.\\n\\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see\\nto it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in\\nthe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the\\nvoyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly\\nconnected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;\\ntherefore, they were going to leave the ship\u2019s stern unprovided with a\\nbuoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a\\nhint concerning his coffin.\\n\\n\u201cA life-buoy of a coffin!\u201d cried Starbuck, starting.\\n\\n\u201cRather queer, that, I should say,\u201d said Stubb.\\n\\n\u201cIt will make a good enough one,\u201d said Flask, \u201cthe carpenter here can\\narrange it easily.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBring it up; there\u2019s nothing else for it,\u201d said Starbuck, after a\\nmelancholy pause. \u201cRig it, carpenter; do not look at me so\u2014the coffin,\\nI mean.

Rig it.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnd shall I nail down the lid, sir?\u201d moving his hand as with a hammer.\\n\\n\u201cAye.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnd shall I caulk the seams, sir?\u201d moving his hand as with a\\ncaulking-iron.\\n\\n\u201cAye.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnd shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?\u201d moving his hand\\nas with a pitch-pot.\\n\\n\u201cAway! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and\\nno more.\u2014Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHe goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he\\nbaulks. Now I don\u2019t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he\\nwears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he\\nwon\u2019t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with\\nthat coffin? And now I\u2019m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It\u2019s like\\nturning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I\\ndon\u2019t like this cobbling sort of business\u2014I don\u2019t like it at all; it\u2019s\\nundignified; it\u2019s not my place. Let tinkers\u2019 brats do tinkerings; we\\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\\nthe conclusion; not a cobbler\u2019s job, that\u2019s at an end in the middle,\\nand at the beginning at the end. It\u2019s the old woman\u2019s tricks to be\\ngiving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\\ntinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\\nbald-headed young tinker once. And that\u2019s the reason I never would work\\nfor lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\\nVineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\\noff with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\\nthe ship\u2019s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\\nthey would do the job. But I\u2019m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\\ndon\u2019t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it\\nif we can. Hem! I\u2019ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\u2019ll have me\u2014let\u2019s\\nsee\u2014how many in the ship\u2019s company, all told? But I\u2019ve forgotten. Any\\nway, I\u2019ll have me thirty separate, Turk\u2019s-headed life-lines, each three\\nfeet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,\\nthere\u2019ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight\\nnot seen very often beneath the sun!

The Pequod Meets The Rachel.\\n\\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down\\nupon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time\\nthe Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the\\nbroad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all\\nfell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from\\nthe smitten hull.\\n\\n\u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere her\\ncommander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he\\ncould hopefully hail, Ahab\u2019s voice was heard.\\n\\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\u201d\\n\\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;\\nand would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger\\ncaptain himself, having stopped his vessel\u2019s way, was seen descending\\nher side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the\\nPequod\u2019s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was\\nrecognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation\\nwas exchanged.\\n\\n\u201cWhere was he?\u2014not killed!\u2014not killed!\u201d cried Ahab, closely advancing.\\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\\n\\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\\nwhile three of the stranger\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of\\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head\\nof Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to\\nleeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\u2014a reserved one\u2014had been\\ninstantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\\nfourth boat\u2014the swiftest keeled of all\u2014seemed to have succeeded in\\nfastening\u2014at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\\nthree far to windward boats\u2014ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\\nprecisely opposite direction\u2014the ship had not only been necessitated to\\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\\nincrease her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sail\u2014stunsail on stunsail\u2014after the\\nmissing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\\nother man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a\\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\\nlast seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\\naround her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\\ntill daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\\nseen.\\n\\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\\n\\n\u201cI will wager something now,\u201d whispered Stubb to Flask, \u201cthat some one\\nin that missing boat wore off that Captain\u2019s best coat; mayhap, his\\nwatch\u2014he\u2019s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\\npious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\\nof the whaling season?

But the captain, for some unknown\\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\\ntill forced to it by Ahab\u2019s iciness did he allude to his one yet\\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer\u2019s paternal love, had\\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years\u2019 voyage\\nin some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\\nwhaleman\u2019s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\\nfather\u2019s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\\nconcern.\\n\\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;\\nand Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without\\nthe least quivering of his own.\\n\\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d said the stranger, \u201ctill you say _aye_ to me. Do to me\\nas you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a\\nboy, Captain Ahab\u2014though but a child, and nestling safely at home now\u2014a\\nchild of your old age too\u2014Yes, yes, you relent; I see it\u2014run, run, men,\\nnow, and stand by to square in the yards.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAvast,\u201d cried Ahab\u2014\u201ctouch not a rope-yarn\u201d; then in a voice that\\nprolongingly moulded every word\u2014\u201cCaptain Gardiner, I will not do it.\\nEven now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I\\nforgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all\\nstrangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.\u201d\\n\\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter\\nrejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,\\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\\nboat, and returned to his ship.\\n\\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\\nround; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat\\nagainst a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the\\nwhile, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three\\ntall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.\\n\\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly\\nsaw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without\\ncomfort.

As the unsetting\\npolar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months\u2019 night\\nsustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab\u2019s purpose now\\nfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It\\ndomineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\\nfears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\\nsingle spear or leaf.\\n\\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\\nstrove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\\nmortar of Ahab\u2019s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the\\ndeck, ever conscious that the old man\u2019s despot eye was on them.\\n\\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when\\nhe thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that\\neven as Ahab\u2019s eyes so awed the crew\u2019s, the inscrutable Parsee\u2019s glance\\nawed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.\\nSuch an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah\\nnow; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious\\nat him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal\\nsubstance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen\\nbeing\u2019s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by\\nnight, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\\nbelow. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan\\nbut wondrous eyes did plainly say\u2014We two watchmen never rest.\\n\\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\\ndeck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\\nor exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,\u2014the\\nmain-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\\ncabin-scuttle,\u2014his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\\nhis hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\\nstood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\\nin his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\\ntell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,\\nthough he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\\nthe unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved\\ncoat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day\u2019s\\nsunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;\\nhe went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin\\nthat thing he sent for.\\n\\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,\u2014breakfast and\\ndinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\\ngrew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still\\ngrow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But\\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\\nParsee\u2019s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\\ntwo never seemed to speak\u2014one man to the other\u2014unless at long intervals\\nsome passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\\nspell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\\ncrew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak\\none word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the\\nslightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a\\nsingle hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\\nother; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\\nParsee his abandoned substance.\\n\\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab\u2014in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\u2014Ahab\\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\\nseemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean\\nshade siding the solid rib.

But\\nif these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\\nverbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\\n\\n\u201cI will have the first sight of the whale myself,\u201d\u2014he said. \u201cAye! Ahab\\nmust have the doubloon!\u201d and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\\nbasketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\\nblock, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\\ndownward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin\\nfor the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with\\nthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round\\nupon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\\nupon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\\nsettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,\u2014\u201cTake the\\nrope, sir\u2014I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\u201d Then arranging his\\nperson in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his\\nperch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\\nafterwards stood near it.

Call all hands!\u201d\\n\\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\\ndeck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\\nseemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\\nwith their clothes in their hands.\\n\\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\n\\n\u201cNothing, nothing sir!\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply.\\n\\n\u201cT\u2019gallant sails!\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\u201d\\n\\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\\nhoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and\\nwhile peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\\nmain-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\\nair. \u201cThere she blows!\u2014there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is\\nMoby Dick!\u201d\\n\\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian\u2019s\\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab\u2019s heel. From this height the whale\\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\\n\\n\u201cAnd did none of ye see it before?\u201d cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\\nall around him.\\n\\n\u201cI saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\\ncried out,\u201d said Tashtego.\\n\\n\u201cNot the same instant; not the same\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!\u2014there she blows!\u2014there she\\nblows! There again!\u2014there again!\u201d he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\u2019s\\nvisible jets. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\\nlower, lower,\u2014quick, quicker!\u201d and he slid through the air to the deck.\\n\\n\u201cHe is heading straight to leeward, sir,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cright away from\\nus; cannot have seen the ship yet.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBe dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\u2014brace up!\\nShiver her!\u2014shiver her!\u2014So; well that! Boats, boats!\u201d\\n\\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\u2019s were dropped; all the boat-sails\\nset\u2014all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\\nFedallah\u2019s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\\n\\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\\nfrom the white whale\u2019s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\\nfeathers streaming like pennons.\\n\\nA gentle joyousness\u2014a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\\ndivinely swam.\\n\\nOn each soft side\u2014coincident with the parted swell, that but once\\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away\u2014on each bright side, the whale\\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\\nthou may\u2019st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\\n\\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia\u2019s\\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\\n\\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\u2019s reappearance.\\n\\n\u201cAn hour,\u201d said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\u2019s stern; and he gazed\\nbeyond the whale\u2019s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.

Their vision was keener than man\u2019s; Ahab could\\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick\u2019s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\\nseizing Perth\u2019s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\\nstand by to stern.\\n\\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale\u2019s head while yet\\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\\nlengthwise beneath the boat.\\n\\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab\u2019s\\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\u2019s heads to gain the\\nuttermost stern.\\n\\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\\nfast to the oars to lash them across.\\n\\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\\nto perceive the whale\u2019s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\\nslipping further into the whale\u2019s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\\nsea.\\n\\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose\u2014some twenty or more feet\\nout of the water\u2014the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\\noverleap its summit with their scud.\\n\\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.\\n\\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\\nassault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus\u2019s elephants in the\\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\\nwhale\u2019s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,\u2014though he\\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\\nhelpless Ahab\u2019s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\\nchance shock might burst. From the boat\u2019s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale\u2019s\\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\\nnow become the old man\u2019s head.\\n\\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship\u2019s\\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!\u2014\u201cSail on\\nthe\u201d\u2014but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,\u2014\u201cSail on the whale!\u2014Drive him\\noff!\u201d\\n\\nThe Pequod\u2019s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\\n\\nDragged into Stubb\u2019s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\u2019s bodily\\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body\u2019s doom: for a\\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb\u2019s boat, like one trodden\\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\\n\\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\\nabbreviate it. In an instant\u2019s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\\nthrough feebler men\u2019s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\\n\\n\u201cThe harpoon,\u201d said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\\none bended arm\u2014\u201cis it safe?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\u201d said Stubb, showing it.\\n\\n\u201cLay it before me;\u2014any missing men?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOne, two, three, four, five;\u2014there were five oars, sir, and here are\\nfive men.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u2014Help me, man; I wish to stand.

For such is\\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature\u2019s future\\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\\nmind of the hunter, as the pilot\u2019s coast is to him. So that to this\\nhunter\u2019s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby\u2019s pulse; and lightly\\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\\nsea must be the whaleman\u2019s allies; for of what present avail to the\\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\\nchase of whales.\\n\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\ncannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\\nfield.\\n\\n\u201cBy salt and hemp!\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cbut this swift motion of the deck\\ncreeps up one\u2019s legs and tingles at the heart.

Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\\nprevious day; the rack of the past night\u2019s suspense; the fixed,\\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\\n\\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things\u2014oak, and maple,\\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\u2014yet all these ran into each\\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\\nof the crew, this man\u2019s valor, that man\u2019s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\\n\\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!\\n\\n\u201cWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab, when, after\\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\\n\u201cSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\\njet that way, and then disappears.\u201d\\n\\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as\u2014much nearer to the ship\\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead\u2014Moby Dick\\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\\nthis breaching is his act of defiance.\\n\\n\u201cThere she breaches! there she breaches!\u201d was the cry, as in his\\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\\nHeaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\\n\\n\u201cAye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201cthy hour\\nand thy harpoon are at hand!\u2014Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\\nfore.

Ahab\u2019s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,\u2014that is, pull straight up\\nto his forehead,\u2014a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whale\u2019s sidelong\\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\\nboats were plain as the ship\u2019s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully man\u0153uvred, incessantly\\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank\u2019s breadth; while all the\\ntime, Ahab\u2019s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\\n\\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\\nand recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\\nlines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\\nwarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\\nfor a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\\ntremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again\u2014hoping\\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls\u2014when lo!\u2014a sight more savage\\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!\\n\\nCaught and twisted\u2014corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\u2019s boat. Only one\\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\\nwithin\u2014through\u2014and then, without\u2014the rays of steel; dragged in the line\\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\\nthe rope near the chocks\u2014dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\\nstirred bowl of punch.\\n\\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\\nman\u2019s line\u2014now parting\u2014admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\\nrescue whom he could;\u2014in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\\nconcreted perils,\u2014Ahab\u2019s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\\nHeaven by invisible wires,\u2014as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\\nagain\u2014gunwale downwards\u2014and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave.\\n\\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\u2014modifying its direction as he\\nstruck the surface\u2014involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\\nback to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\\nside to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or\\ncrumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\\ncame sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\\nleeward way at a traveller\u2019s methodic pace.\\n\\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\\nclinging to his boat\u2019s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day\u2019s mishap.\\n\\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\\n\\n\u201cAye, aye, Starbuck, \u2019tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\\nwill; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThe ferrule has not stood, sir,\u201d said the carpenter, now coming up; \u201cI\\nput good work into that leg.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBut no bones broken, sir, I hope,\u201d said Stubb with true concern.\\n\\n\u201cAye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!\u2014d\u2019ye see it.\u2014But even with a\\nbroken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\\nmine one jot more me, than this dead one that\u2019s lost.

God only\\nhas that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\\nand a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too\\nmuch for that.

There\u2019s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a\\nmost malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that\\nthere\u2019s something all glorious and gracious in the wind.

Aye, minus a\\nleg, that\u2019s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live\\nflesh every way.

And at last when Ahab was sliding\\nby the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\u2019s face as he\\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\\nfollow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\\nhe saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\\nrepairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\\nsped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\\nseemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied.
